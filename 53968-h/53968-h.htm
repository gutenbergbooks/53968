<h3 class='c006'>THE TWO EMPRESSES.—THE PRINCESS PAULINE.—ELOQUENT<br /> EFFUSION OF THE EMPEROR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>On another of these evenings, the Emperor was holding
forth against the caprice of women: “Nothing,” said
he, “more clearly indicates rank, education, and good
breeding among them, than evenness of temper and the
constant desire to please.” He added that they were
bound by circumstances to appear at all times mistresses
of themselves, and to be always attending to their part
on the stage. His two wives, he observed, had always
been so: they certainly differed greatly in their qualities
and dispositions; but they always agreed in this point.
Never had he witnessed ill-humour in either the one or
the other: to please him had been the constant object
with both of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one ventured to observe, however, that Maria-Louisa
had boasted that, whenever she desired any thing,
no matter how difficult, she had only to weep. The
Emperor laughed, and said, this was new to him. He
might have suspected it of Josephine, but he had no idea
of it in Maria-Louisa. And then, addressing himself
to Mesdames Bertrand and Montholon: “Thus it is
with you all, ladies,” said he: “in some points you all
agree.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He continued for a long time to talk about the two
Empresses, and repeated, as usual, that one was Innocence,
and the other the Graces. He passed from them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>to his sisters, and dwelt particularly on the charms of
the Princess Pauline. It was admitted that she was,
without dispute, the handsomest woman in Paris. The
Emperor said that the artists were unanimous in considering
her a perfect Venus de Medicis. A little pleasantry
was hazarded on the influence which the Princess
Pauline had exercised, at the Island of Elba, over General
Drouot, whose assiduous attentions she attracted in spite
of the difference of their ages and the harshness of his
countenance. The Princess, it was said, had drawn
from him the secret of the intended departure, eight
days before it took place. He had repeated the fault of
Turenne; and upon this the Emperor said, “Such are
women, and such is their dangerous power!” Here
Madame Bertrand declared that the Grand Marshal, to
a certainty, had not done as much. “Madame,” retorted
the Emperor with a smile, “he was only your husband.”
Some one having remarked that the Princess Pauline,
when at Nice, had set up a post-waggon on the road, by
which dresses and fashions arrived from Paris every day,
the Emperor said: “If I had been aware of it, that
should not have lasted long, she should have been well
scolded. But thus it happens: while one is Emperor
one knows nothing of these matters.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After this conversation the Emperor enquired what
was the day of the month: it was the 11th of March.
“Well!” said he, “it is a year ago to-day, it was a
brilliant day; I was at Lyons, I reviewed some troops, I
had the Mayor to dine with me, who, by the way, has
boasted since that it was the worst dinner he ever made
in his life.” The Emperor became animated; he paced
the chamber quickly. “I was again become a great
power,” he continued: and a sigh escaped him, which
he immediately checked with these words, in an accent
and with a warmth which it is difficult to describe: “I
had founded the finest empire in the world, and I was so
necessary to it that, in spite of all the last reverses, here,
upon my rock, I seem still to remain the master of
France. Look at what is going on there, read the
papers, you will find it so in every line. Let me once
more set my foot there, they will see what France is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and what I can do!” And then what ideas, what projects,
he developed for the glory and happiness of the
country! He spoke for a long time, with so much
interest, and so unreservedly, that we could have forgotten
time, place, and seasons. A part of what he said
follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a fatality,” he said, "that my return from the
Island of Elba was not acquiesced in, that every one did
not perceive that my reign was desirable and necessary
for the balance and repose of Europe! But kings and
people both feared me; they were wrong, and may pay
dearly for it. I returned a new man; they could not
believe it; they could not imagine that a man might have
sufficient strength of mind to alter his character, or to
bend to the power of circumstances. I had, however,
given proofs of this, and some pledges to the same
effect. Who is ignorant that I am not a man for half-measures?
I should have been as sincerely the monarch
of the constitution and of peace, as I had been of absolute
sway and great enterprises.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Let us reason a little upon the fears of kings and
people on my account. What could the kings apprehend?
Did they still dread my ambition, my conquests, my
universal monarchy? But my power and my resources
were no longer the same; and, besides, I had only
defeated and conquered in my own defence: this is a
truth which time will more fully develop every day.
Europe never ceased to make war upon France, her
principles, and me; and we were compelled to destroy,
to save ourselves from destruction. The coalition always
existed openly or secretly, avowed or denied; it was
permanent; it only rested with the Allies to give us
peace; for ourselves, we were worn out; the French
dreaded making new conquests. As to myself, is it
supposed that I am insensible to the charms of repose
and security, when glory and honour do not require it
otherwise? With our two Chambers, they might have
forbidden me in future to pass the Rhine; and why
should I have wished it? For my universal monarchy?
But I never gave any convincing proof of insanity; and
what is its chief characteristic, but a disproportion between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>our object and the means of attaining it. If I
have been on the point of accomplishing this universal
monarchy, it was without any original design, and because
I was led on to it step by step. The last efforts
wanting to arrive at it seemed so trifling, was it very
unreasonable to attempt them? But, on my return from
Elba, could a similar idea, a thought so mad, a purpose
so unattainable, enter the head of the silliest man in the
world? The Sovereigns, then, had nothing to fear from
my arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Did they apprehend that I might overwhelm them
with anarchical principles? But they knew by experience
my opinions on that point. They have all seen me occupy
their territories: how often have I been urged to
revolutionize their states, give municipal functions to
their cities, and excite insurrection among their subjects!
However I may have been stigmatized, in their names,
as <em>the modern Attila, Robespierre on horseback</em>, &amp;c.
they all know better at the bottom of their hearts—let
them look there! Had I been so, I might perhaps still
have reigned; but they most certainly would have long
since ceased to reign. In the great cause of which I saw
myself the chief and the arbiter, one of two systems was
to be followed: to make kings listen to reason from the
people; or to conduct the people to happiness by means
of their kings. But it is well known to be no easy matter
to check the people when they are once set on: it
was more rational to reckon a little upon the wisdom
and intelligence of rulers. I had a right always to suppose
them possessed of sufficient intellect to see such
obvious interests: I was deceived; they never calculated
at all, and in their blind fury, they let loose against me
that which I withheld when opposed to them. They
will see!!!</p>

<p class='c001'>"Lastly, did the Sovereigns take umbrage at seeing a
mere soldier attain a crown? Did they fear the example?
The solemnities, the circumstances, that accompanied
my elevation, my eagerness to conform to their habits,
to identify myself with their existence, to become allied
to them by blood and by policy, closed the door sufficiently
against new comers. Besides, if there must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>needs have been the spectacle of an interrupted legitimacy,
I maintain that it was much more to their interest
that it should take place in my person, one risen from
the ranks, than in that of a prince, one of their own
family: for thousands of ages will elapse before the
circumstances accumulated in my case draw forth another
from among the crowd to reproduce the same spectacle;
while there is not a Sovereign who has not, at a few
paces distance in his palace, cousins, nephews, brothers,
and relations, to whom it would be easy to follow such
an example if once set.</p>

<p class='c001'>"On the other side, what was there to alarm the
people? Did they fear that I should come to plunder
and to impose chains on them?—On the contrary, I came
the Messiah of peace and of their rights: this new
maxim was my whole strength—to violate it would have
been ruin. But even the French mistrusted me; they
had the insanity to discuss, when there was nothing to do
but to fight; to divide, when they should have united
on any terms. And was it not better to run the risk of
having me again for master than to expose themselves
to that of being subjected to a foreign yoke? Would it
not have been easier to rid themselves of a single despot,
of one tyrant, than to shake off the chains of all the
nations united? And moreover, whence arose this mistrust
of me? Because they had already seen me concentrate all
efforts in myself, and direct them with a vigorous hand?
But do they not learn at the present day, to their cost,
how necessary that was? Well! the danger was in any
case the same: the contest terrible, and the crisis imminent.
In this state of things, was not absolute power
necessary, indispensable? The welfare of the country
obliged me even to declare it openly on my return from
Leipsic. I should have done so again on my return
from Elba. I was wanting in consistency, or rather in
confidence in the French, because many of them no
longer placed any in me, and it was doing me a great
wrong. If narrow and vulgar minds only saw, in all my
efforts, a care for my own power, ought not those of
greater scope to have shewn that, under the circumstances
in which we were placed, my power and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>country were but one! Did it require such great and
incurable mischiefs to enable them to comprehend me?
History will do me more justice: it will signalize me as
the man of self-denials and disinterestedness. To what
temptations was I not exposed in the army of Italy?
England offered me the Crown of France at the time of
the treaty of Amiens.—I refused peace at Châtillon: I
disdained all personal stipulations at Waterloo;—and
why? Because all this had no reference to my country,
and I had no ambition distinct from her’s—that of her
glory, her ascendancy, her majesty. And there is the
reason that, in spite of so many calamities, I am still so
popular among the French. It is a sort of instinct of
after-justice on their part.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Who in the world ever had greater treasures at his
disposal? I have had many hundred millions in my
vaults; many other hundreds composed my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>domaine de
l’extraordinaire</em></span>: all these were my own. What is
become of them?—They were poured out in the distresses
of the country. Let them contemplate me here: I live
destitute upon my rock. My fortune was wholly in that
of France. In the extraordinary situation to which fate
had raised me, my treasures were her’s: I had identified
myself completely with her destinies. What other calculation
was consistent with the height to which I had
risen? Was I ever seen occupied about my personal
interests? I never knew any other enjoyment, any other
riches, than those of the public;—so much so, that when
Josephine, who had a taste for the Arts, succeeded under
the sanction of my name in acquiring some master-pieces,
though they were in my palace, under my eyes, in my
family apartments, they offended me, I thought myself
robbed: <em>they were not in the Museum</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! the French people undoubtedly did much for
me! more than was ever done before for man! But, at
the same time, who ever did so much for them? who
ever identified himself with them in the same manner?
But to return.—After all, what could be their fears?
Were not the Chambers and the new Constitution
sufficient guarantees for the future? Those additional
Acts, against which so much indignation was expressed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>did they not carry in themselves their own corrective—remedies
that were infallible? How could I have
violated them? I had not myself millions of arms; I was
but one man. Public opinion raised me up once more;
public opinion might equally put me down again; and,
compared with this risk, what had I to gain?”</p>

<p class='c001'>"But as to surrounding States (I speak particularly as
regards England), what could be her fears, her motives,
her jealousies? We enquire in vain. With our new
Constitution, our two Chambers, had we not adopted her
creed for the future? Was not that the sure means of
coming to a mutual understanding, to establish in future
a community of interest? The caprice, the passions of
their rulers, once fettered, the interests of the people move
on, without obstacle, in their natural course: look at the
merchants of hostile nations; they continue their intercourse,
and pursue their business however their governments
may wage war. The two nations had arrived at
that point.—Thanks to their respective parliaments, each
would have become the guarantee for the other: and
who can ever tell to what extent the union of the two
nations and of their interests might have been carried;
what new combinations might have been set to work?
It is certain that, on the establishment of our two Chambers
and our Constitution, the Ministers of England had
in their hands the glory and prosperity of their <a id='corr9.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='country‘'>country,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_9.26'><ins class='correction' title='country‘'>country,</ins></a></span>
the destinies and the welfare of the world. Had I
beaten the English army and won my last battle, I should
have caused a great and happy astonishment; the following
day I would have proposed peace, and, for once, it
would have been I who scattered benefits with a prodigal
hand. Instead of this, perhaps, the English will one
day have to lament that they were victorious at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I repeat it, the people and the sovereigns were
wrong: I had restored thrones and an inoffensive nobility;
and thrones and nobility may again find themselves
in danger. I had fixed and consecrated the reasonable
limits of the people’s rights; vague, peremptory
and undefined claims may again arise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had my return, my <a id='corr9.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='establisment'>establishment</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_9.40'><ins class='correction' title='establisment'>establishment</ins></a></span> on the throne, my
adoption, been freely acquiesced in by the sovereigns, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>cause of kings and the people would have been settled;
both would have gained. Now they are again to try it;
both may lose. They might have concluded every thing;
they may have every thing to begin again: they might
have secured a long and certain calm, and already begun
to enjoy it: and, instead of that, a spark may now be
sufficient to re-produce a general conflagration! Poor,
weak humanity!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Attached, as I am, to the words and the opinions which
I gathered from Napoleon on his rock of exile, and however
perfectly persuaded and convinced of their entire
sincerity, I do not the less experience an extreme gratification,
whenever a testimony from another quarter confirms
the truth of them; and I am bound to say that I
have that gratification as often as opportunity occurs of
obtaining other evidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reader has just perused the foregoing remarkable
passage, in which Napoleon expresses his ideas, his intentions,
his sentiments. What a value do not these expressions
collected at St. Helena acquire, when we find
them re-echoed in Europe, at the distance of 2000
leagues, by a celebrated writer, who, with a shade of
difference in his opinions, and at a very different time,
had himself received them from the same lips! What a
fortunate circumstance for history! I cannot, indeed, forbear
bringing forward here this extract from M. Benjamin
Constant, as well on account of the intrinsic merit
of the expressions, as from the weight they acquire from
the distinguished writer who records them; and also
from the pleasure I feel in seeing them coincide so exactly
with what I have collected myself in another hemisphere.
There are the same intentions, the same depth
of thought, the same sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I went to the Tuileries,” says M. Benjamin Constant
in his account; "I found Bonaparte alone. He began
the conversation: it was long: I will only give an analysis
of it; for I do not propose to make an exhibition of
an unfortunate man. I will not amuse my readers at the
expense of fallen greatness; I will not give up to malevolent
curiosity him whom I have served, whatever might
be my motive; and I will not transcribe more of his discourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>than is indispensable: but in what I shall transcribe,
I will use his own words.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He did not attempt to deceive me either as to his
views, or the state of affairs. He did not present himself
as one corrected by the lessons of adversity: he did
not desire to take the merit of returning to liberty from
inclination; he investigated coolly, as regarded his interest,
and, with an impartiality too nearly allied to
indifference, what was possible and what was preferable.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘The nation,’ said he, ‘has rested for twelve years
from all political agitation, and for a year it has been
undisturbed by war: this double repose has begotten a
necessity for motion. It desires, or fancies it desires, a
public rostrum and assemblies; it has not always desired
them. It cast itself at my feet when I came to the government;
you must remember, you who made trial of
its opinion. Where was your support, your power? No
where. I took less authority than I was invited to take.
Now all is changed. A weak government, opposed to
the interests of the nation, has given these interests the
habit of taking up the defensive, and of cavilling at
authority. The taste for constitutions, debates, harangues,
seems to return.... However, it is only the
minority that desires it, do not deceive yourself. The people,
or if you like it better, the mob, desire me alone; you
have not seen them, this mob, crowding after me, rushing
from the tops of the mountains, calling me, seeking me,
saluting me.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> On my return hither from Cannes, I did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>not conquer—I administered.... I am not only, as it
has been said, the Emperor of the soldiers; I am the
Emperor of the peasants, of the lower ranks in France....
Thus, in spite of all that is past, you see the people
return to me—there is a sympathy between us. It
is not so with the privileged classes; the nobility have
served me, have rushed in crowds into my ante-chambers,
there are no offices that they have not accepted, solicited,
pressed for. I have had my <em>Montmorencies</em>, my <em>Noailles</em>,
my <em>Rohans</em>, my <em>Beauveaus</em>, my <em>Mortemarts</em>. But there
was no analogy between us. The steed curvetted, he
was well trained, but I felt him quivering under me.
With the people it is another thing; the popular fibre
responds to mine: I am come from the ranks of the
people, my voice has influence over them. Observe these
conscripts, these sons of peasants, I did not flatter them,
I treated them with severity; they did not the less surround
me, they did not the less shout ‘<em>The Emperor for
ever!</em>’ It is because between them and me there is an
identity of nature; they look to me as their support, their
defender against the nobles.... I have but to make a
sign, or rather to turn away my eyes, and the nobles will
be massacred in all the departments. They have carried
on such fine intrigues for these six months!... But
I will not be the King of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Jacquerie</em></span>. If there are any
means of governing with a Constitution, well and good.....
I wished for the empire of the world; and, to
insure it, unlimited power was necessary to me. To
govern France only, a Constitution may be better....
I wished for the empire of the world, and who in my
situation would not have wished for it? The world invited
me to govern it: sovereigns and subjects vied with
each other in hastening beneath my sceptre. I have
rarely found any opposition in France; but I have, however,
met with more from some obscure unarmed Frenchmen,
than from all those kings, so vain at present of no
longer having a popular man for their equal.... Consider,
then, what seems to you to be possible. Give me
your ideas. Free elections, public discussions, responsible
ministers, liberty, all this is my wish.... The
liberty of the press in particular: to stifle it is absurd—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>am satisfied upon this point.... I am the man of
the people, if the people sincerely wish for liberty: I owe
it to them. I have recognised their sovereignty; I am
bound to lend an ear to their desires, even to their caprices.
I never desired to oppress them for my own gratification.
I had great designs, fate has decided them;
I am no longer a conqueror, I can no more become so.
I know what is possible and what is not; I have now
but once charge—to relieve France, and to give her a
government that is suited to her.... I am not inimical
to liberty: I set it aside when it obstructed my road;
but I comprehend it, I have been educated in its principles....
At the same time, the work of fifteen
years is destroyed; it cannot begin again. It would require
twenty years, and the sacrifice of two millions of
men.... Besides I am desirous of peace, and I shall
obtain it only by dint of victories. I will not hold out
false hopes to you; I cause reports to be circulated that
negotiations are on foot; but there are none. I foresee
a difficult contest, a long war. To maintain it, the nation
must support me; but in return, it will require
liberty,—and it shall have it.... The situation is
new. I desire no better than to receive information; I
grow old; a man is no longer at forty-five what he was
at thirty. The repose of a constitutional monarch may
be well suited to me. It will assuredly be still more
suitable to my son.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>13th.—The Emperor sent instructions to the Grand
Marshal to write to the Admiral to enquire if a letter
which he, Napoleon, should write to the Prince Regent
would be sent to him. Towards four o’clock, the Deputy
Governor Skelton and his lady desired to pay their
respects to the Emperor. He received them, took them
to walk in the garden, and afterwards out with him in
his carriage. The weather had been extremely foggy
all day. Upon its clearing up for a short time we saw,
on a sudden, a corvette or frigate very near, and coming
in with all sails set.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>INSULT TO THE EMPEROR AND THE PRINCE OF WALES.—EXECUTION<br /> OF NEY.—ESCAPE OF LAVALETTE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>14th—15th. We received the Admiral’s answer.
After beginning, according to his established form, by
saying that he knew no person by the title of ‘Emperor’
at St. Helena, he stated, that he would undoubtedly
send the Emperor’s letter to the Prince Regent: but
that he should adhere to the tenor of his instructions,
which directed him not to allow any paper to be despatched
to England, without having first opened it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This communication, it must be acknowledged, gave
us great astonishment: the part of the instructions cited
by the Admiral had two objects in view, both of them
foreign to the interpretation put upon them by this
officer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first was, in the case of our making any complaints,
that the local authorities might add their observations,
and that the government, in England, might do
us justice more speedily, without being obliged to send
again to the island for farther information. This precaution,
then, was entirely for our interest. The second
object of this measure was that our correspondence might
not be prejudicial to the interests of the government or
the policy of England. But we were writing to the
Sovereign, to the chief, to the individual in whom these
interests and this government centered: and if there
was any conspiracy here, it was not on the part of us, who
were writing to him, but rather on his who intercepted
our letter, or resolved to violate the privacy of it. That
they should place jailors about us with all their equipage,
though we did not consider it just, still it seemed
possible. But that these jailors should cause their functions
to react, even upon their Sovereign, was a thing
for which we could not find a name! It was to attach to
him completely the idea of a King without faculties, or
of a Sultan buried in the recesses of his Seraglio! It
was really a monstrous phenomenon in our European
manners!</p>

<p class='c001'>For a long time, we had little or no intercourse with
the Admiral. One thought that ill humour had perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>dictated his answer; another supposed that he was fearful
the letter might contain some complaints against
him. But the Admiral knew the Emperor too well,
not to be aware that he would never appeal to any other
tribunal than to that of nations. I, who knew what
would have been the subject of the letter, felt the most
lively indignation at it! The sole intention of the Emperor
had been to employ this method, the only one that
seemed compatible with his dignity, to write to his wife,
and obtain tidings of his son. However, the Grand
Marshal replied to the Admiral that he either over-stepped,
or misinterpreted his instructions; that his determination
could only be regarded as another instance
of flagrant vexation; that the condition imposed was
too much beneath the dignity of the Emperor, as well as
of the Prince Regent, for him to retain any intention
of writing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frigate that had just arrived was the Spey, bringing
the European papers to the 31st December: they
contained the execution of the unfortunate Marshal Ney,
and the escape of Lavalette.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ney,” said the Emperor, “as ill attacked as defended,
had been condemned by the Chamber of Peers,
in the teeth of a formal capitulation. His execution had
been allowed to take place; that was another error—from
that moment he became a martyr. That Labedoyere
should not have been pardoned, because the clemency
extended to him would have seemed only a predilection
in favour of the old Aristocracy, might be conceived;
but the pardon of Ney would only have been a proof of
the strength of the government, and the moderation of
the Prince. It will be said, perhaps, that an example
was necessary! But the Marshal would become so, much
more certainly, by a pardon, after being degraded by a
sentence: it was, to him, in fact, a moral death that
deprived him of all influence; and nevertheless the object
of authority would be obtained, the Sovereign satisfied,
the example complete. The refusal of pardon to
Lavalette, and his escape, were new grievances equally
unpopular,” said the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the saloons of Paris,” he observed, “exhibited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the same passions as the clubs; the nobility were a new
version of the Jacobins. Europe, moreover, was in a
state of complete anarchy; the code of political immorality
was openly followed; whatever fell into the hands
of the Sovereigns was turned to the advantage of each
of them. At least in my time I was the butt of all
the accusations of this kind. The Sovereigns then talked
of nothing but principles and virtue; but now,” added
he, “that they are victorious and without control, they
practise unblushingly all the wrongs which they themselves
then reprobated. What resource and what hope were
there then left for nations and for morality? Our countrywomen
at least,” he observed, “have rendered their
sentiments illustrious: Madame Labedoyere was on the
point of dying from grief, and these papers shew us
that Madame Ney has displayed the most courageous
and determined devotion. Madame Lavalette is become
the heroine of Europe.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MESSAGE FOR THE PRINCE REGENT.</h3>

<p class='c007'>16th.—The Emperor had quitted the Encyclopedia
Britannica, to take his lessons in English in the <cite>Annual
Register</cite>. He read there the adventure of a Mr. Spencer
Smith, arrested at Venice, ordered to be sent to Valenciennes,
and who made his escape on the road. “This
must be a very simple affair,” said the Emperor, “which
the narrator has converted into a statement of importance.”
The circumstance was totally unknown to him;
it was a police affair of too little consequence, he observed,
to have found its way up to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>About four o’clock the captain of the Spey, just arrived
from Europe, and the captain of the Ceylon, about
to sail for England, were presented to the Emperor.
He was in low spirits—he was unwell: the audience of
the first was very short; that of the second would have
been the same, had he not roused the Emperor by asking
if we had any letters to send to Europe. The Emperor
then desired me to ask him if he should see the
Prince Regent; on his answering in the affirmative, I
was charged to inform him that the Emperor was desirous
of writing to the Prince Regent, but that in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of the observation of the Admiral, that he would
open the letter, he had abstained from it, as being inconsistent
with his dignity and with that of the Prince Regent
himself: that he had, indeed, heard the laws of England
much boasted of, but that he could not discover their
benefits anywhere; that he had only now to expect,
indeed to desire, an executioner; that the torture they
made him endure was inhuman, savage; that it would
have been more open and energetic to put him to death.
The Emperor made me request of the captain that he
would take upon him to deliver these words, and dismissed
him: he looked very red and was much embarrassed.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>SPIRIT OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLE OF FRANCE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>17th.—An English Colonel, arrived from the Cape on
his return from the Isle of France, came in the morning
and addressed himself to me, to try to get an introduction
to the Emperor. The Admiral had only allowed his
vessel to remain two or three hours in the road. Having
prevailed on the Emperor to receive him at four
o’clock, he assured me that he would rather miss his
vessel than lose such an opportunity. The Emperor
was not very well, he had passed several hours in his
bath; at four he received the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor put many questions to him concerning
the Isle of France, lately ceded to the English; it seems
that its prosperity and its commerce suffer from its
change of sovereignty.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the departure of the Colonel, being alone with
the Emperor in the garden, I told him that his person
seemed to have remained very dear to the inhabitants of
the Isle of France; that the Colonel had informed me
that the name of Napoleon was never pronounced there
but with commiseration. It was precisely on the day of
a great festival in the colony, that they learned his departure
from France and his arrival at Plymouth; the
theatre was to be particularly attractive: the news having
arrived during the day, in the evening there was not a
single colonist, either white or of colour, in the house:
there were only some English, who were exceedingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>confused and irritated at the circumstance. The Emperor
listened to me. “It is quite plain,” said he, after
some moments’ silence; “this proves that the inhabitants
of the Isle of France have continued French. I
am the country; they love it: it has been wounded in
my person, they are grieved at it.” I added that the
change of dominion restraining their expressions, they
durst not propose his health publicly; but that the
Colonel said they never neglected it notwithstanding;
they drank to <em>him</em>, this word had become consecrated to
Napoleon. These details touched him. “Poor Frenchmen!”
he said with emphasis—"Poor People! Poor
Nation! I deserved all that, I loved thee! But thou,
thou surely didst not deserve all the ills that press upon
thee! Ah! thou didst merit well that one should devote
himself to thee! But what infamy, what baseness, what
degradation, it must be confessed, I had about me!"
And, addressing himself to me, he added: “I do not
speak here of your friends of the Fauxbourg-Saint-Germain;
for with respect to them it is another matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There frequently reached us incidents and expressions
which, like those from the Isle of France, were calculated
to excite emotion in the heart. The Island of
Ascension, in our neighbourhood, had always been desert
and abandoned; since we have been here, the English
have thought proper to form an establishment there.
The captain who went to take possession of it told us, on
his return, that he was much astonished on landing to find
upon the beach, <em>May the great Napoleon live for ever!</em></p>

<p class='c001'>In the last papers that reached us, among many good-natured
sallies, it was remarked, in several languages,
that <em>Paris</em> would never be happy till his <em>Helen</em> should
be restored to him: these were a few drops of honey in
our cup of wormwood.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>HIS INTENTIONS RESPECTING ROME.—HORRIBLE<br /> FOOD.—BRITANNICUS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>18th—19th. The Emperor was on horseback by
eight o’clock. He had abstained from it for a long time:
want of space to ride over was the cause. His health
suffers visibly in consequence, and it is astonishing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the want of exercise is not still more hurtful to him, who
was in the daily habit of taking it to a violent degree.
On our return, the Emperor breakfasted out of doors;
he detained us all. After breakfast, the conversation
fell on Herculaneum and Pompeii; the phenomenon and
epoch of their destruction, the time and the accident of
their modern discovery, the monuments and the curiosities,
which they have since afforded us. The Emperor
said that if Rome had remained under his dominion,
she would have risen again from her ruins: he intended
to have cleared away all the rubbish; to have restored as
much as possible. He did not doubt that, the same spirit
extending through all the vicinity, it might have been in
some degree the same with Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c001'>Breakfast being concluded, the Emperor sent my son
to bring the volume of Crevier which contains this event;
and he read it to us, as well as the death and character
of Pliny. He retired about noon to take some rest.
Towards six o’clock we took our usual round in the carriage.
The Emperor took with him Mr. and Mrs. Skelton,
who were come to visit him.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our return, the Emperor, driven from the garden
by the damp, went to see General Gourgaud, who was
recovering rapidly. After dinner, on leaving the table
and returning to the drawing-room, we could not help
reverting to the meal we had just made;—literally nothing
was fit to eat: the bread bad, the wine not drinkable,
the meat disgusting and unwholesome: we are
frequently obliged to send it back again. They continue
in spite of our remonstrances, to send it to us dead,
because by that method they can put us off with such
animals as have died naturally.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, shocked at this representation, could
not refrain from saying, with warmth: “No doubt there
are people whose physical situation is still worse; but
that circumstance does not deprive us of the right of
giving an opinion on our own condition, or on the infamous
manner in which we are treated. The injustice of
the English government, not content with sending us
hither, has extended to the selection of the individuals to
whom our persons and the supply of our wants are intrusted!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>For my part, I should suffer less if I were sure
that it would one day be divulged to the whole world in
such a way as to brand with infamy those who are guilty
of it. But let us talk of something else,” said he—“what
is the day of the month?” He was told it was
the 19th of March: “What!” he exclaimed, “the eve
of the 20th of March!” And a few seconds afterwards:
“But let us talk of something else.” He sent for a
volume of Racine, and at first began to read the comedy
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Plaideurs</cite></span>: but, after a scene or two, he turned
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Britannicus</cite></span>, which he read to us. When the reading
was concluded, and the due tribute of admiration had
been paid, he said that Racine was censured for making
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>dénouement</em></span> of this piece too sudden, that the poisoning
of Britannicus was not expected so early in the play
as it ought to have been. He highly praised the truth
of the character of Narcissus, observing that it was
always by wounding the self-love of princes that their
determinations were most influenced.</p>

<p class='c001'>20TH OF MARCH.—THE ACCOUCHEMENT OF THE
EMPRESS.</p>

<p class='c001'>20th.—After dinner one of us observed to the Emperor
that he had been less solitary, less quiet, that day twelve-month
at the same hour. “I was sitting down to
table at the Tuileries,” said the Emperor. “I had found
it difficult to get thither: the dangers I went through
in that attempt were at least equal to those of a battle.”
In fact he had been seized, on his arrival, by thousands
of officers and citizens; one party had snatched
him from another; he had been carried to the palace,
and, amidst a tumult like that of a mob about to tear a
man to pieces, instead of the orderly and respectful attendance
of a multitude intent on shewing their veneration
for an individual. But we ought to look at the sentiment
and intention in this case: it was enthusiasm, and
love, carried to a pitch that resembled rage or madness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor added that in all probability more than
one person in Europe would talk of him that evening;
and that, in spite of all observation, many a bottle would
be emptied on his account.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The conversation then turned on the King of Rome;
that day was the anniversary of his birth; the Emperor
reckoned that he must be five years old. He then spoke
of the accouchement of the Empress, and seemed to
take some pleasure in boasting that he had proved himself,
on that occasion, as good a husband as any in the
world. He assisted the Empress to walk about all night.
We who were of the household knew something of the
matter; we had all been called together at the palace at ten
in the evening; we passed the night there; and the cries
of the Empress sometimes reached our ears. Towards
morning the accoucheur having told the Emperor that the
pains had ceased, and that the labour might yet be tedious,
the Emperor went to the bath, and sent us away, desiring
us, however, not to go from home. The Emperor had
not been long in the bath, when the pains came on
again; and the accoucheur ran to him, almost out of his
wits, saying he was the most unfortunate of men; that
out of a thousand labours in Paris there was not one
more difficult. The Emperor, dressing himself again as
fast as he could, encouraged him, saying that a man
who understood his business ought never to lose his
presence of mind; that there was nothing in this case
that he ought to be uneasy about; that he had only to
fancy he was delivering a citizen’s wife of the Rue Saint-Denis:
that nature had but one law; that he was sure
he would act for the best; and, above all, that he need
not fear any reproach. It was then represented to the
Emperor that there was great danger either for the mother
or the child. “If the mother lives,” said he, without
hesitation, "I shall have another child. Act in this
case as if you were attending the birth of a <a id='corr21.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='cobler’s'>cobbler’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_21.32'><ins class='correction' title='cobler’s'>cobbler’s</ins></a></span> son."</p>

<p class='c001'>When he reached the Empress she really was in danger;
the child presented itself in an unfavourable posture,
and there was every reason to fear that it would
be stifled.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The Emperor asked Dubois why he did not deliver
her. He excused himself, being unwilling to do it, he
said, except in the presence of Corvisart, who had not
yet arrived. “But what can he tell you?” said the
Emperor. “If it is a witness, or a justification, you
want to secure, here am I.” Then Dubois, taking off
his coat, commenced the operation. When the Empress
saw the instruments, she cried out in a piteous manner,
exclaiming that they were going to kill her. She was
firmly held by the Emperor, Madame de Montesquiou,
Corvisart, who had just come in, &amp;c. Madame de Montesquiou
dexterously took an opportunity to encourage
her, by declaring that she herself had more than once
been in the same situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Empress, however, still persuaded herself that
she was treated differently from other women, and often
repeated, “Am I to be sacrificed because I am an Empress?”
She declared, afterwards, to the Emperor, that
she really had entertained this fear. At length she was
delivered. The danger had been so imminent, said the
Emperor, that all the etiquette which had been studied
and ordered was disregarded, and the child put on one
side, on the floor, whilst every one was occupied about
the mother only. The infant remained some moments

<h3 class='c009'>CATILINE’S CONSPIRACY.—THE GRACCHI.—HISTORIANS.—SLEEP DURING A BATTLE.—CÆSAR AND HIS COMMENTARIES OF DIFFERENT MILITARY SYSTEMS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>21st—22nd. The Emperor rode out very early: we
made the tour of our limits in several directions. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>during these rides that the Emperor now takes his lessons
in English. I walk by his side; he speaks a few
sentences in English, which I translate, word by word,
as he pronounces them; by which method he perceives
when he is understood, or is enabled to correct his mistakes.
When he has finished a sentence, I repeat it to
him in English, so that he may understand it well himself:
this helps to form his ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was reading to-day, in the Roman History,
of Catiline’s conspiracy; he could not comprehend
it in the way in which it is described. “However great
a villain Catiline might be,” observed he, “he must have
had some object in view: it could not be that of governing
in Rome, since he is accused of having intended to
set fire to the four quarters of the city.” The Emperor
conceived it to be much more probable that it was
some new faction similar to those of Marius and Sylla,
which having failed, all the accusations calculated to
excite the horror of patriots, were, as usual in such cases,
heaped on the head of its leader. It was then observed
to the Emperor that the same thing would infallibly
have happened to himself, had he been overpowered in
Vendemiaire, Fructidor, or Brumaire, before he had
illumined with such radiant brilliancy an horizon cleared
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Gracchi gave rise to doubts and suspicions of a
very different sort in his mind, which, he said, became
almost certainties to those who had been engaged in the
politics of our times. “History,” said he, "presents
these Gracchi, in the aggregate, as seditious people, revolutionists,
criminals; and, nevertheless, allows it to
appear, in detail, that they had virtues; that they were
gentle, disinterested, moral men; and, besides, they
were the sons of the illustrious Cornelia, which, to great
minds, ought to be a strong primary presumption in their
favour. How then can such a contrast be accounted for?
It is thus: the Gracchi generously devoted themselves
in behalf of the rights of the oppressed people, against a
tyrannical senate; and their great talents and noble
character endangered a ferocious aristocracy, which triumphed,
murdered, and calumniated them. The historians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of a party have transmitted their characters in the
same spirit. Under the Emperors it was necessary to
continue in the same manner; the bare mention of the
rights of the people, under a despotic master, was a
blasphemy, a downright crime. Afterwards, the case
was the same under the feudal system, which was so
fruitful in petty despots. Such, no doubt, is the fatality
which has attended the memory of the Gracchi. Throughout
succeeding ages their virtues have never ceased to
be considered crimes; but at this day, when, possessed
of better information, we have thought it expedient to
reason, the Gracchi may and ought to find favour in our
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In that terrible struggle between the aristocracy and
democracy, which has been renewed in our times—in
that exasperation of ancient landed property against modern
industry, which still ferments throughout Europe,
there is no doubt that if the aristocracy should triumph
by force, it would point out many Gracchi in all directions,
and treat them as mercifully as its predecessors
did the Gracchi of Rome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor added that it was, moreover, easy to
see that there was a hiatus in the ancient authors at
this period of history; that all which the moderns now
presented to us on this subject was mere gleaning. He
then reverted to the charges already made against honest
Rollin and his pupil Crevier: they were both devoid of
talent, system, or colouring. It was to be allowed that
the ancients were far superior to us in this point; and
that because, amongst them, statesmen were literary men,
and men of letters statesmen; they combined professions,
whilst we divide them in an absolute manner.
This famous division of labour, which in our times produces
such a perfection in mechanical arts, is quite fatal
to excellence in mental productions: every work of genius
is superior in proportion to the universality of the
mind whence it emanates. We owe to the Emperor the
attempt to establish this principle by frequently employing
on various objects men wholly unconnected with each
other;—it was his system. He once appointed, of his
own accord, one of his chamberlains to go into Illyria to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>liquidate the Austrian debt: this was a matter of importance,
and extremely complicated. The chamberlain, who
had previously been a total stranger to public business,
was alarmed; and the minister, who had been deprived
of this appointment, being dissatisfied with it, ventured
to represent to the Emperor that, his nomination having
fallen on a man entirely new to such matters, it might
be feared that he would not acquit himself satisfactorily.
“I have a lucky hand, sir,” was his answer: “those on
whom I lay it are fit for every thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, proceeding in his criticism, also censured
severely what he called historical fooleries, ridiculously
exalted by translators and commentators. “Such
things prove, in the first place,” said he, “that the historians
formed erroneous judgments of men and circumstances.
They are wrong, for instance,” said Napoleon,
“when they applaud so highly the <em>continence of Scipio</em>,
and fall into ecstasies at the calmness of Alexander,
Cæsar, and others, for having been able to sleep on the
eve of a battle. It could only be a monk, debarred from
women, whose face brightens up at the very name—who
neighs behind his bars at their approach, who could give
Scipio much credit for forbearing to violate the female
whom chance threw into his power, while he had so
many others entirely at his disposal. A famished man
might as well praise the hero for having quietly passed by
a table covered with victuals, without greedily snatching
at them.” As to sleeping just before a battle, there was
not, he assured us, one of our soldiers or generals who
had not twenty times performed that miracle; their
heroism was chiefly produced by the fatigue of the day
before.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Grand Marshal added that he could safely
say he had seen Napoleon sleep, not only on the eve of
an engagement, but even during the battle. “I was
obliged to do so,” said Napoleon, “when I fought battles
that lasted three days; Nature was also to have her
due: I took advantage of the smallest intervals, and slept
where and when I could.” He slept on the field of battle
at Wagram, and at Bautzen, even during the action, and
completely within the range of the enemy’s balls. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>this subject, he said that, independently of the necessity
of obeying nature, these slumbers afforded a general,
commanding a very large army, the important advantage
of enabling him to await, calmly, the reports and combinations
of all his divisions, instead of, perhaps, being
hurried away by the only event which he himself could
witness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor farther said that he found in Rollin, and
even Cæsar, circumstances of the Gallic war which he
could not understand. He could not by any means comprehend
the invasion of the Helvetii; the road they took;
the object ascribed to them; the time they spent in crossing
the Saone; the diligence of Cæsar, who found time
to go into Italy, as far as Aquileia, in quest of reinforcements,
and who overtook the invaders before they had
passed the Saone, &amp;c.; that it was equally difficult to
comprehend what was meant by establishing winter-quarters
that extended from Treves to Vannes. And as
we expressed our surprise at the immense works which
the generals got performed by their soldiers, the ditches,
walls, great towers, galleries, &amp;c., the Emperor observed
that in those times all efforts were directed to construction
on the spot, whereas in ours they were employed in
conveyance. He also thought the ancient soldiers laboured,
in fact, more than ours. He had thoughts of dictating
something on that subject. “Ancient history, however,”
said he, “embraces a long period, and the system of war
often changed. In our days it was no longer that of the
times of Turenne and Vauban: field-works were growing
useless; even the system of our fortresses had become
problematical or inefficient; the enormous quantity of
bombs and howitzers changed every thing. It was no
longer against the horizontal attack that defence was requisite,
but also against the curve and the reflected lines.
None of the ancient fortresses were henceforth safe;
they ceased to be tenable; no country was rich enough
to maintain them. The revenue of France would be insufficient
for her lines in Flanders, for the exterior fortifications
were now not above a fourth or fifth of the
necessary expense. Casements, magazines, places of
shelter secure from the effects of bombs, were now indispensably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>requisite, and these were too expensive.” The
Emperor complained particularly of the weakness of
modern masonry: the engineer department is radically
defective in this point; it had cost him immense sums,
wholly thrown away.</p>

<p class='c001'>Struck with these novel truths, the Emperor had invented
a system altogether at variance with the axioms
hitherto established; it was to have metal of an extraordinary
calibre, to advance beyond the principal line
towards the enemy; and to have that principal line
itself, on the contrary, defended by a great quantity of
small moveable artillery: hence the enemy would be
stopped short in his sudden advance; he would have only
weak pieces to attack powerful ones with; he would be
commanded by this superior calibre, round which the
resources of the fortress, the small pieces, would form in
groups, or even advance to a distance, as skirmishers,
and might follow all the movements of the enemy by
means of their lightness and mobility. The enemy would
then stand in need of battering-cannon; he would be
obliged to open trenches: time would be gained, and the
true object of fortification accomplished. The Emperor
employed this method with great success, and to the
great astonishment of the engineers, in the defence of
Vienna, and in that of Dresden; he intended to use it in
that of Paris, which city could not, he thought, be defended
by any other means; but of the success of this
method he had no doubt.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DAYS AT LONGWOOD.—TRIAL OF DROUOT.—MILITARY CHARACTERS.—SOULT.—MASSENA.—THE EMPEROR’S COMRADES IN THE ARTILLERY—HIS NAME THOUGHT BY HIM TO BE UNKNOWN TO SOME PEOPLE, EVEN IN PARIS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>23rd—26th. The weather was very unfavourable during
the greater part of these mornings, on account of
the heavy rains, which scarcely allowed us to stir out of
doors. The Emperor read a work by a Miss Williams,
on the return from the Isle of Elba; it had just reached
us from England. He was much disgusted with it, and
with good reason: this production is quite calumnious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and false; it is the echo and collection of all the reports
invented at the time in certain malevolent Parisian
societies.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to our evenings, the weather was almost indifferent
to us; whether it rained, or the moon shone brightly,
we literally made ourselves prisoners. Towards nine
o’clock we were surrounded by sentinels; to meet them
would have been painful. It is true that both the Emperor
and ourselves might have gone out at a later hour,
accompanied by an officer; but this would have been
rather a punishment than a pleasure to us, although the
officer never could conceive this feeling. He gave us
reason to conclude, at first, that he imagined this seclusion
to be merely the effect of ill-humour, and thought it
would not last long. I know not what he may subsequently
have thought of our perseverance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, as I believe I have already mentioned,
sat down to table pretty regularly at eight o’clock; he
never remained there above half an hour; sometimes
scarcely a quarter of an hour. When he returned to the
drawing-room, if he happened to be unwell or taciturn,
we had the greatest difficulty in the world to get on till
half-past nine or ten o’clock; indeed, we could not effect
it without the assistance of reading. But when he was
cheerful, and entered into conversation with spirit, we
were presently surprised to find it eleven o’clock, and
later: these were our pleasant evenings. He would then
retire, with a kind of satisfaction, at having, as he expressed
it, conquered time. And it was precisely on
those days, when the remark applied with least force,
that he used to observe that it must require our utmost
courage to endure such a life.</p>

<p class='c001'>On one of these evenings, the conversation turned
upon the military trials, which are now taking place in
France. The Emperor thought that General Drouot
could not be condemned for coming in the suite of one
acknowledged sovereign to make war upon another. On
this it was remarked that what was now mentioned as
his justification would be his greatest danger at the tribunal
of legitimacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor acknowledged, in fact, that there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>nothing to be said to the doctrines brought forward at
this day: but, on the other hand, that, in condemning
General Drouot, they would condemn emigration, and
legitimize the condemnation of the emigrants. Whomsoever
was found in arms against France, the Republican
doctrines punished with death; it was not so with the
Royal doctrine. If they should in this instance adopt
the Republican doctrine, the emigrant and royal party
would condemn themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case of Drouot, however, in a general point
of view, was very different even from that of Ney; and
besides, Ney had evinced an unfortunate vacillation of
which Drouot had never been guilty. Thus the interest
which Ney had excited was wholly founded on opinion;
whilst that which was felt for Drouot was personal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor dilated on the dangers and difficulties
which the tribunals and ministers of justice must experience,
throughout the affairs connected with his return
from the Isle of Elba. Above all, he was extremely
struck by a particular circumstance relating to Soult, who,
we were told, was to be brought to trial. He (Napoleon)
knew, he said, how innocent Soult was; and yet, were it
not for that circumstance, and were he an individual and
juror in Soult’s case, he had no doubt he should declare
him guilty, so strongly were appearances combined
against him. Ney, in the course of his defence, through
some sentiment which it is difficult to account for, stated,
contrary to the truth, that the Emperor had said Soult
was in intelligence with him. Now, every circumstance
of Soult’s conduct during his administration, the confidence
which the Emperor placed in him after his return,
&amp;c., agreed with that deposition: who, then, would not
have condemned him? “Yet Soult is innocent,” said the
Emperor, “he even acknowledged to me that he had
taken a real liking to the King. The authority he enjoyed
under him,” he said, “so different from that of my
ministers, was a very agreeable thing, and had quite
gained him over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Massena (whose proscription was also announced to
us by the papers) was, the Emperor said, another person
whom they would perhaps condemn as guilty of treason.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>All Marseilles was against him; appearances were overwhelming;
and yet he had fulfilled his duty up to the
very moment of declaring himself openly. On his return
to Paris, he had even been far from claiming any credit
with the Emperor, when the latter asked him whether
he might have reckoned upon him. “The truth is,”
continued the Emperor, "that all the commanders did
their duty; but they could not withstand the torrent of
opinion, and no one had sufficiently calculated the sentiments
of the mass of the people and the national impetuosity.
Carnot, Fouché, Maret, and Cambaceres, confessed
to me, at Paris, that they had been greatly deceived
on <a id='corr30.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='his'>this</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_30.13'><ins class='correction' title='his'>this</ins></a></span> point. And no one understands it well;
even now.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Had the King remained longer in France,” continued
he, “he would probably have lost his life in some insurrection;
but, had he fallen into my hands, I should have
thought myself strong enough to have allowed him every
enjoyment in some retreat of his own selection; as Ferdinand
was treated at Valency.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately before this conversation, the Emperor
was playing at chess, and his king having fallen, he
cried out—"Ah! my poor king, you are down!" Some
one having picked it up, and restored it to him in a mutilated
state—"Horrid!" he exclaimed; “I certainly
do not accept the omen, and I am far from wishing any
such thing: my enmity does not extend so far.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I would not, on any account, have omitted this circumstance,
trifling as it may appear, because it is in
many respects characteristic. We ourselves, when the
Emperor had retired, reverted to the incident. What
cheerfulness, what freedom of mind in such dreadful
circumstances! we said. What serenity in the heart!
what absence of malice, irritation, or hatred! Who
could discover in him the man whom enmity and falsehood
have depicted as such a monster! Even amongst
his own followers, who is there that has well understood
him, or taken sufficient pains to make him
known?</p>

<p class='c001'>On another evening, the Emperor was speaking of
his early years, when he was in the artillery, and of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>companions at the mess: he always delighted in reverting
to those days. One of his messmates was mentioned,
who, having been Prefect of the same department under
Napoleon and under the King, had not been able to
retain his place on the return of Napoleon. The Emperor,
when he recollected him, said that this person had,
at a certain period, missed the opportunity of making his
fortune through him. When Napoleon obtained the
command of the army of the Interior, he loaded this person
with favours, made him his aide-de-camp, and intended
to place great confidence in him; but this favoured
aide-de-camp had behaved very ill to him at the time
of his departure for the Army of Italy: he then abandoned
his General for the Directory. “Nevertheless,”
said the Emperor, "when once I was seated on the
throne, he might have done much with me, if he had
known how to set about it. He had the claim of early
friendship, which never loses its influence; I should certainly
never have withstood an unexpected overture in a
hunting-party, for instance, or half an hour’s conversation
on old times at any other opportunity. I should
have forgotten his conduct: it was no longer important
whether he had been on my side or not: I had united
all parties. Those who had an insight into my character
were well aware of this: they knew that, with me, however
I might have felt disposed towards them, it was like
the game of prison-bars; when once the point was
touched, the game was won. In fact, if I wished to
withstand them, I had no resource but that of refusing
to see them."</p>

<p class='c001'>He mentioned another old comrade, who, with intelligence
and the requisite qualifications, might have done
any thing with him. He also said that a third would
never have been removed from him, had he been less
rapacious.</p>

<p class='c001'>We disputed amongst ourselves whether these people
ever suspected the secret, or their own chances; and
whether the elevated station and the Imperial splendour
of Napoleon, had fairly allowed them to avail themselves
of his favourable disposition towards them.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the splendour of the Imperial power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the Grand Marshal said that, however great and magnificent
the Emperor had appeared to him on the throne,
he had never made on him a superior, perhaps an equal,
impression, to that which his situation at the head of the
Army of Italy had stamped on his memory. He explained
and justified this idea very successfully, and the
Emperor heard him with some complacency.—But, we
observed, what great events took place afterwards! what
elevation! what grandeur! what renown throughout
the world! The Emperor had listened. “For all that,”
said he, “Paris is so extensive, and contains so many
people of all sorts, and some so eccentric, that I can
conceive there may be some who never saw me, and
others who never even heard my name mentioned. Do
not you think so?” And it was curious to see with what
whimsical ingenuity he himself maintained this assertion,
which he knew to be untenable. We all insisted loudly
that, as to his name, there was not a town or village in
Europe, perhaps even in the world, where it had not
been pronounced. One person in company added—"Sire,
before I returned to France at the treaty of
Amiens, your Majesty being then only <span class='sc'>First</span> Consul, I
determined to make a tour in Wales, as one of the most
extraordinary parts of Great Britain. I climbed the
wildest mountains, some of which are of prodigious
height; I visited cabins that seemed to me to belong to
another world. As I entered one of these secluded
dwellings, I observed, to my fellow-traveller, that, in
this spot, one would expect to find repose, and escape
the din of revolution. The cottager, suspecting us to be
French, on account of our accent, immediately enquired
the news from France, and what <em>Bonaparte</em>, the First
Consul, was about."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” said another, "we had the curiosity to ask
the Chinese officers whether our European affairs had
been heard of in their Empire. ‘Certainly,’ they replied;
‘in a confused manner, to be sure, because we are totally
uninterested in those matters; but the name of your
Emperor is famous there, and connected with grand
ideas of conquest and revolution:’ exactly as the names
of those who have changed the face of that part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>world have arrived in ours, such as Gengis Khan,
Tamerlane," &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>POLITICAL EXAMINATION OF CONSCIENCE.—FAITHFUL STATEMENT OF THE CONDITION AND PROSPERITY OF THE EMPIRE.—LIBERAL IDEAS OF THE EMPEROR ON THE INDIFFERENCE OF PARTIES.—MARMONT.—MURAT.—BERTHIER.</h3>

<p class='c007'>27th.—This day the Emperor was walking in the
garden with the Grand Marshal and me. The conversation
led us to make our political self-examination.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said that he had been very warm and sincere
at the commencement of the Revolution; that he had
cooled by degrees, in proportion as he acquired more
just and solid ideas. His patriotism had sunk under the
political absurdities and monstrous domestic excesses
of our legislatures. Finally, his republican faith had
vanished on the violation of the choice of the people, by
the Directory, at the time of the battle of Aboukir.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Grand Marshal said that, for his part, he had
never been a republican; but a very warm constitutionalist
until the 10th of August, the horrors of which
day had cured him of all illusion. He had very nearly
been massacred in defending the King at the Tuileries.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for me, it was notorious that I had begun my
career as a pure and most ardent royalist. “Why, then,
it seems, gentlemen,” humorously observed the Emperor,
“that I am the only one amongst us who has been a
republican.”—"And something more, Sire," Bertrand
and I both replied.—"Yes," repeated the Emperor,
“republican and patriot.”—"And I have been a patriot,
Sire," replied one of us, “notwithstanding my royalism;
but, what is still more extraordinary, I did not become
so till the period of the Imperial reign.”—"How!
rogue!—are you compelled to own that you did not
always love your country?"—"Sire, we are making our
political self-examination, are we not? I confess my sins.
When I returned to Paris, by virtue of your amnesty,
could I at first look upon myself as a Frenchman, when
every law, every decree, every ordinance that covered
the walls, constantly added the most opprobrious epithets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to my unlucky denomination of Emigrant. Nor did I
think of remaining, when I first arrived. I had been
attracted by curiosity, yielding to the invincible influence
of one’s native land, and the desire of breathing the air
of one’s country. I now possessed nothing there: in
order to be allowed only to see France once more, I had
been compelled, at the frontier, to swear to the relinquishment
of my patrimony, to accede to the laws which
decreed its loss; and I looked on myself as a mere traveller
in that country once mine. I was a true foreigner,
discontented and even malevolent. The empire came;
it was a great event. Now," said I, “my manners,
prejudices, and principles triumph; the only difference
is in the person of the sovereign. When the
campaign of Austerlitz opened, my heart, with surprise,
found itself once more French. My situation was painful;
I felt as if torn limb from limb; I was divided between
blind passion and national sentiment: the triumphs of
the French army and their general displeased me; yet
their defeat would have humbled me. At length, the
prodigies of Ulm, and the splendour of Austerlitz, put
an end to my embarrassment. I was vanquished by
glory.—I admired, I acknowledged, I loved Napoleon;
and from that moment I became French to enthusiasm.
Henceforth I have had no other thoughts, spoken no
other language, felt no other sentiments; and here I am
by your side.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then asked innumerable questions relative
to the Emigrants, their numbers, and disposition.
I related many curious facts respecting our princes, the
Duke of Brunswick, and the King of Prussia. I made
him laugh at the extravagance of our presumption, our
unbounded confidence of success, the disorder of our
affairs, the incapacity of our leaders. “Men,” said I,
“really were not at that time what they have since been.
Fortunately, those with whom we had to contend were,
at first, only our equals in strength. Above all, we
thought, and repeated to one another, that an immense
majority of the French nation was on our side; and, for
my part, I firmly believed it. I soon had, however, an
opportunity of being undeceived; when our parties having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>arrived at Verdun, and beyond it, not a single person
came to join us; on the contrary, every one fled at our
approach. Nevertheless I still believed it, even after
my return from England; so greatly did we deceive
ourselves afterwards with the absurdities that we related
to each other. We said that the government was vested
in a handful of people; that it was maintained by force
alone; that it was detested by the nation; and there
must be some who have never ceased to think so. I am
persuaded that, amongst those who now talk in that
manner in the Legislative Body, there are some who
speak as they think; so perfectly do I recognise the
spirit, the ideas, and the expressions of Coblentz.”—“But
at what period were you undeceived?” said the
Emperor.—“Very late, Sire. Even when I rallied, and
came to your Court, I was led much more by admiration
and sentiment, than by conviction of your strength and
stability. However, when I came into your Council of
State, seeing the freedom with which the most decisive
decrees were voted, without a single thought of the
slightest resistance; seeing around me nothing but conviction
and entire persuasion, it then appeared to me
that your power, and the state of affairs, gained strength
with a rapidity that I could not account for. By pondering
on the cause of this change, I at length made a
great and important discovery; namely, that matters
had long stood thus, but that I had neither known, nor
been willing to perceive, it; I had hid my head under
the bushel, lest the light should reach my eyes. Now
that I found myself forced into the midst of its brightness,
I was dazzled by it. From that moment, all my
prejudices fell to the ground; the film was taken from
my eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Being afterwards sent by your Majesty on a mission,
and having traversed more than sixty departments, I
employed the most scrupulous attention and the most
perfect sincerity in ascertaining the truth of which I had
so long doubted. I interrogated the prefects, the inferior
authorities; I caused documents and registers to be
produced to me; I questioned private individuals without
being known to them; I employed all possible means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>trying the truth of my conclusions, and I remained fully
convinced that the government was completely national,
and founded in the will of the people; that France had,
at no period of her history, been more powerful, more
flourishing, better governed, or more happy; the roads
had never been better maintained; agriculture had increased
by a tenth, a ninth, perhaps an eighth in its
productions.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> A restlessness, a general ardour animated
all minds to exertion, and inspired them to aim at a
daily personal improvement. Indigo was gained; sugar
would inevitably be so. Never, at any period, had internal
commerce and industry of every species, been
carried to such a pitch; instead of four millions of livres
in cotton, which were used at the Revolution, more than
thirty millions were now manufactured, although we
could obtain none by sea, and received it over-land from
the distance of Constantinople. Rouen was become quite
a prodigy in production. The taxes were everywhere
paid; the Conscription was nationalized; France, instead
of being exhausted, contained a more numerous population
than before, and was daily increasing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I again appeared amongst my former acquaintance
with these data, there was an absolute insurrection
against me. They laughed in my face, and almost hooted
me. Yet there were some sensible people amongst them,
and I now possessed strong grounds of argument; I
staggered many, and convinced a few; thus I too have
had my victories.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said it must be agreed that our being
assembled at St. Helena from political causes was certainly
a most extraordinary circumstance: that we had
come to a common centre by roads originally leading
in very different <a id='corr36.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='drections'>directions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_36.33'><ins class='correction' title='drections'>directions</ins></a></span>. However, we had travelled
through them with sincerity. Nothing more clearly
proved the sort of chance, the uncertainty, and the fatality
which usually, in the labyrinth of revolutions, direct
upright and honest hearts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Nor can any thing more clearly prove, continued he,
how necessary indulgence and intelligent views are to recompose
society after long disorders. It was these dispositions
and these principles which had made him, he said,
the most fit man for the circumstances of the month of
<em>Brumaire</em>; and it was those which still rendered him
without doubt the fittest in the actual state of France.
On this point he had neither mistrust, nor prejudice, nor
passion; he had constantly employed men of all classes,
of all parties, without ever looking back, without enquiring
what they had done, what they had said, what they
had thought; only requiring, he said, that they should
pursue in future and with sincerity the common object—the
welfare and the glory of all—that they should shew
themselves true and good Frenchmen. Above all, he had
never made overtures to leaders in order to gain over
parties; but, on the contrary, he had attacked the mass
of the parties, that he might be in a situation to despise
their leaders. Such had ever been the uniform system
of his internal policy; and, in spite of the last events, he
was far from repenting it; if he had to begin again he
should pursue the same course. “It is totally without
reason,” he said, “that I have been reproached with employing
nobles and emigrants—a perfectly trite and vulgar
imputation! The fact is that under me there only
existed individual opinions and sentiments. It is not the
nobles and the emigrants who have brought about the
restoration, but rather the restoration that has again
raised the nobles and the emigrants. They have not
contributed more particularly to our ruin than others:
those really in fault are the intriguers of all parties and all
opinions. Fouché was not a noble; Talleyrand was not
an emigrant; Augereau and Marmont were neither. To
conclude, do you desire a final proof of the injustice of
blaming whole classes, when a revolution like ours has
operated in the midst of them? Reckon yourselves here:
among four, you find two nobles, one of whom was even
an emigrant. The excellent M. de Ségur, in spite of his
age, at my departure, offered to follow me. I could
multiply examples without end.—It is with as little reason,”
he continued, "that I have been blamed for having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>neglected certain persons of influence; I was too powerful
not to despise with impunity the intrigues, and the
known immorality, of the greater part of them. None of
these causes have therefore contributed to my downfall;
but only unforeseen and unheard-of catastrophes; compulsory
circumstances; 500,000 men at the gates of the
capital; a revolution still recent; a crisis too powerful
for French heads; and, above all, a dynasty not sufficiently
ancient. I should have risen again even from the foot of
the Pyrenees, could I but have been my own grandson.</p>

<p class='c001'>"And, moreover, what a fascination there is respecting
past times! It is most certain that I was chosen by
the French: their new worship was their own work.
Well! immediately upon the return of their old forms,
see with what facility they have returned to their idols.</p>

<p class='c001'>"And, after all, how could another line of policy have
prevented that which ruined me? I have been betrayed
by M—— whom I might call my son, my offspring,
my own work; him to whom I had committed my destinies,
by sending him to Paris, at the very moment that
he was putting the finishing hand to his treason and my
ruin. I have been betrayed by Murat, whom I had
raised from a soldier to a king; who was my sister’s
husband. I have been betrayed by Berthier, a mere
goose, whom I had converted into a kind of eagle. I
have been betrayed in the senate, by those very men of
the national party who owe every thing to me. All that,
then, did not in any way depend upon my system of
internal policy. Undoubtedly I should have been exposed
to the charge of too readily employing old enemies,
whether nobles or emigrants, if a Macdonald, a Valence,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
a Montesquiou had betrayed me; but they were faithful:
let them object to me the stupidity of Murat, I can oppose
to it the intelligence of Marmont. I have, then, no
cause to repent of my system of internal policy."</p>

  <h3 class='c006'>CHANCE OF DANGER IN BATTLE, &amp;C.—THE BULLETINS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'>VERY CORRECT.</p>

<p class='c001'>28th.—The Emperor during dinner was speaking of
the probability of danger in the Chinese ships, of which
one in thirty perished, according to the accounts he had
received from some captains. This led him to the chances
of danger in battle, which he said were less than that.
Wagram was pointed out to him as a destructive battle;
he did not estimate the killed at more than 3,000, which
was only a fiftieth: we were there 160,000. At Essling
they were about 4000, we were 40,000: this was a
tenth; but it was one of the most severe battles. The
others were incomparably lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>This brought on a conversation on the bulletins. The
Emperor declared them to be very correct: assured us
that, excepting what the proximity of the enemy compelled
him to disguise, that when they came into their
hands they might not derive any information prejudicial
to him from them, all the remainder was very exact. At
Vienna and throughout Germany they did them more
justice than among us. If they had acquired a bad character
in our armies—if it was a common saying, <em>as false
as a bulletin</em>, it was personal rivalships, party spirit,
that had established it: it was the wounded self-love
of those who were not mentioned in them, and who had,
or fancied they had, a right to a place there: and still
more than all, our ridiculous national defect of having
no greater enemies to our successes and our glory than
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor after dinner played some games at chess.
The day had been very rainy: he was unwell and retired
early.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>UNHEALTHINESS OF THE ISLAND.</h3>

<p class='c007'>26th. The weather was still bad; it was impossible
to set foot out of doors. The rain and the damp invaded
our pasteboard apartments. Every one of us suffered
in his health in consequence. The temperature here is
certainly mild, but the climate is among the most unwholesome.
It is a thing ascertained in the island, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>few there attain the age of fifty; hardly any that of
sixty. Add to this, exclusion from the rest of the world,
physical privations, bad moral treatment, and it will result
that prisons in Europe are far preferable to liberty
in St. Helena.</p>

<p class='c001'>About four o’clock several Captains from China were
brought to me, who were to be presented to the Emperor.
They had an opportunity of seeing the smallness,
the dampness, and bad state of my habitation. They
enquired how the Emperor found himself in point of
health. It declined visibly, I told them. Never did we
hear a complaint from him: his great soul suffered
nothing to overcome it, and even contributed to deceive
him with respect to his own state: but we could see
him decay very perceptibly. I led them shortly after
to the Emperor who was walking in the garden. He
seemed to me at that moment more disordered than
usual. He dismissed them in half an hour. He went
in again, and took a bath.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before and after dinner he seemed in low spirits and
in pain. He began to read to us <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Femmes Savantes</cite></span>;
but at the second act he handed the book to the Grand
Marshal, and dozed upon the sofa during the reading of
the remainder.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>REMARKS OF THE EMPEROR ON HIS EXPEDITION<br /> IN THE EAST.</h3>

<p class='c007'>30th–31st. This day the weather has continued very
bad; we all suffered from it: besides, we are absolutely
eaten up with rats, fleas, and bugs: our sleep is disturbed
by them, so that the troubles by night are in
perfect harmony with those by day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The weather changed entirely to fair on the 31st; we
went out in the carriage. The Emperor, in the course
of conversation, observed, speaking of Egypt and Syria,
that if he had taken St. Jean d’Acre, as ought to have
been the case, he should have wrought a revolution in
the East. “The most trivial circumstances,” said he,
"lead to the greatest events. The weakness of the captain
of a frigate, who stood out to sea instead of forcing
a passage into the harbour, some trifling impediments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>with respect to some sloops or light vessels, prevented
the face of the world from being changed. Possessed of
St. Jean d’Acre, the French army would have flown to
Damascus and Aleppo; in a twinkling it would have
been on the Euphrates; the Christians of Syria, the
Druses, the Christians of Armenia, would have joined
it: nations were on the point of being shaken." One
of us having said that they would have speedily been
re-inforced with 100,000 men—"Say 600,000," replied
the Emperor; “who can calculate what it might have
been? I should have reached Constantinople and the
Indies; I should have changed the face of the world.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>SUMMARY OF THE LAST NINE MONTHS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Nine months have already elapsed from the commencement
of my Journal; and I fear that, amid the heterogeneous
matters that succeed without order in it, I may
have often lost sight of my principal, my only, object—that
which concerns Napoleon, and may serve to characterize
him. It is to make up for this, where necessary,
that I here attempt a summary in a few words;
a summary which I propose, moreover, on the same account,
to repeat, in future, at intervals of three months.</p>

<p class='c001'>On quitting France, we remained for a month at the
disposal of the brutal and ferocious English Ministry;
then our passage to St. Helena occupied three months.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our landing we occupied Briars nearly two
months.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, we have been three months at Longwood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, these nine months would have formed four very
distinct epochs, with one who had taken the pains to
observe Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the time of our stay at Plymouth, Napoleon remained
thoughtful, and merely passive, exerting no
power but that of patience. His misfortunes were so
great, and so incapable of remedy, that he suffered
events to take their course with stoic indifference.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the whole of our passage, he constantly possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a perfect equanimity, and, above all, the most
complete indifference; he expressed no wish, shewed no
disappointment. It is true, the greatest respect was
paid him; he received it without perceiving it; he spoke
little, and the subject was always foreign to himself.
Any one who, coming suddenly on board, had witnessed
his conversation, would undoubtedly have been far from
guessing with whom they were in company: it was not
the Emperor. I cannot better picture him in this situation
than by comparing him to those passengers of high
distinction who are conveyed with great respect to their
destination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our abode at Briars presented another shade of difference.
Napoleon, left almost entirely to himself, receiving
nobody, constantly employed, seeming to forget
events and men, enjoyed, apparently, the calm and the
peace of a profound solitude; either from abstraction or
contempt, not condescending to notice the inconveniences
or privations with which he was surrounded. If he now
and then dropped an expression relative to them, it was
only when roused by the importunity of some Englishman,
or excited by the recital of the outrages suffered by
his attendants. His whole day was occupied in dictation;
the rest of the time dedicated to the relaxation of
familiar conversation. He never mentioned the affairs
of Europe; spoke rarely of the Empire, very little of the
Consulate; but much of his situation as General in Italy;
still more, and almost constantly, of the minutest details
of his childhood and his early youth. The latter subjects,
especially, seemed at this time to have a peculiar charm
for him. One would have said that they afforded him a
perfect oblivion; they excited him even to gaiety. It
was almost exclusively with these objects that he employed
the many hours of his nightly walks by moonlight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, our establishment at Longwood was a fourth
and last change. All our situations hitherto had been
but short and transitory. This was fixed, and threatened
to be lasting. There, in reality, were to commence
our exile and our new destinies. History will take them
up there; there the eyes of the world were to be directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to consider us. The Emperor, seeming to make this
calculation, regulates all about him, and takes the attitude
of dignity oppressed by power; he traces around
him a moral boundary, behind which he defends himself,
inch by inch, against indignity and insult. He no
longer gives way on any point to his persecutors; he
shews himself sensibly jealous in respect to forms,
and hostile to all encroachment. The English never
doubted that habit would, in the end, produce formality.
The Emperor brings them to it from the first
day, and the most profound respect is manifested.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was no small surprise to us, and no slight satisfaction
to have to observe among ourselves, that, without
knowing how or why, it was nevertheless perceptible
that the Emperor now stood higher in the opinion and
the respect of the English than he had hitherto done: we
could even perceive that this sentiment was every day
increasing. With us the Emperor resumed entirely, in
his conversations, the examination of the affairs of Europe.
He analyzed the projects and the conduct of the
Sovereigns: he compared them with his own; weighed,
decided, spoke of his reign, of his deeds; in a word, we
once more found him the Emperor, and <em>all</em> Napoleon.
Not that he had ever ceased to be so for an instant, as
regarded our devotion and our attentions; neither had
we, on our side, had any thing to endure from him in
any respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never did we experience a more even temper, a more
constant kindness, a more unaltered affection. It was,
in fact, among us, as in the midst of his family, that he
concerted his attacks upon the common enemy; and
those which appear the most vigorous, and seem to be
dictated by anger, were, however, almost always accompanied
with some laughter or pleasantry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor’s health, during the six months preceding
our establishment at Longwood, did not seem to
undergo any change; though his regimen was so completely
altered. His hours, his food, were no longer the
same; his habits were completely deranged. He who
had been accustomed to so much exercise had been
confined all this time to a room. Bathing had become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>part of his existence, and he was constantly deprived of
it. It was not till after his arrival at Longwood, and
when he was again supplied with some of these things,
when he rode on horseback, and returned to the use of
the bath, that we began to perceive a sensible alteration.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a singular circumstance that, so long as he was
uncomfortably situated he suffered nothing; it was not
till he was better off that he was seen to be in pain.
May it not be that, in the moral as in the physical system,
there is often a long interval between causes and
their effects?</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMPEROR’S APARTMENTS.—MINUTE DETAILS OF HIS TOILET AND DRESS.—ABSURD REPORTS RESPECTING HIM.—CONSPIRACIES OF GEORGES AND CERACHI.—ATTEMPT OF THE FANATIC OF SCHÖNBRUNN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>April 1st—2nd. All that is in any way connected with
the Emperor Napoleon must be worthy of observation,
and will be held valuable by thousands. With this conviction,
I shall proceed minutely to describe his apartment,
its furniture, the details of his toilet, &amp;c. And, in
course of time, may not his son one day take pleasure in
re-producing these details, picturing to himself the appearance
of distant objects, and seizing fleeting shadows,
which to him will perhaps supply the place of reality?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor’s own apartments consist of two chambers
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em>,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> each 45 feet long and 42 broad, and
about 7 feet high. A very indifferent carpet covers the
floor, and pieces of nankin, instead of paper, line the
walls of both rooms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bed-chamber <em>A</em> contains the little camp-bed <em>a</em>, in
which the Emperor sleeps, and the couch <em>b</em>, on which
he reclines the greater part of the day. This couch is
covered with books, which seem to dispute with the Emperor
the right of possession to it. Beside this couch
stands a small table <em>c</em>, on which the Emperor breakfasts
and dines, when he takes his meals in his own chamber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and which, in the evening, bears a candlestick with
three branches, surmounted by a large ornament. Between
the two windows, and opposite to the door, stands
a chest of drawers <em>d</em>, containing the Emperor’s linen, and
on the top of which is his large dressing-case.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over the fire-place <em>e</em>, hangs a very small glass, together
with several pictures. On the right is a portrait
of the King of Rome sitting on a sheep, by Aimée Thiebault—and
on the left hangs, as a pendant to it, another
portrait of the young Prince, sitting on a cushion and
putting on a slipper. This picture is also the production
of Thiebault. Lower down is a small marble bust
of the King of Rome. Two candlesticks, two scent-bottles,
and two cups of silver gilt, taken from the Emperor’s
cabinet, complete the arrangement and decoration
of the chimney-piece. Lastly, at the foot of the couch,
and directly in view of the Emperor when he reposes on
it, which he does the greater part of the day, hangs
Isabey’s portrait of Maria Louisa, holding her son in
her arms. This wretched little closet has thus become a
family sanctuary. I must not omit to mention Frederick
the Great’s large silver watch, which is a sort of alarum.
It was taken at Potsdam and it hangs on the left of the
chimney-piece, beyond the portraits. The Emperor’s
own watch, which hangs on the right of the chimney, is
the same that he used in the Campaigns of Italy; it is
enclosed in a gold case, marked with his cipher <span class='fss'>B:</span><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
These are the contents of the first chamber.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second room <em>B</em>, which serves as a sort of study,
along the walls next the windows are several rough
boards, supported by trestles, on which are scattered a
great number of books, and the manuscripts that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>been written from the Emperor’s dictation. Between
the two windows is a book-case <em>g</em>; and on the opposite
side stands another camp-bedstead <em>h</em>, similar to the one
already mentioned. On this bed the Emperor sometimes
reposes in the day-time; and he occasionally lies
down on it, when he rises from the other bed during
his frequent sleepless nights, or when fatigued with dictating,
or walking about alone in his chamber. Lastly,
in the middle of the room stands the writing-table <em>i</em>,
with marks indicating the places usually occupied by the
Emperor and each of us during his dictations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor dresses in his bed-room. When he
takes off his clothes, which he does without assistance,
he throws them all upon the floor if one of his valets
happens not to be at hand to take them from him. How
many times have I stooped to pick up the cordon of the
Legion of Honour, when I have seen it thrown carelessly
on the ground!</p>

<p class='c001'>Shaving, which is almost the last business of the
Emperor’s toilet, is not commenced until he has put on
his stockings, shoes, &amp;c. He shaves himself: first taking
off his shirt, and retaining only his flannel waistcoat,
which he had laid aside during the excessive heat
we experienced in crossing the Line, but which he was
obliged to resume at Longwood, in consequence of a
severe attack of the cholic; from this, however, the
use of his flannel waistcoat speedily relieved him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor shaves in the recess of the window
nearest to the fire-place. His first valet de chambre
hands him the soap and razor: and the second holds
before him the looking-glass of his dressing-case, so that
the Emperor may turn to the light the side that he is
shaving. It is the business of the second valet de chambre
to tell him whether or not he shaves clean. Having
shaved one side, he turns completely round to shave the
other, and the valets change sides.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then washes his face, and very frequently
his head, in a large silver basin <em>f</em>, which is fixed in a
corner of the room, and which was brought from the
Elysée. The Emperor is very lusty; his skin is white,
with but few hairs; and he has a certain plumpness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>which is unusual in the male sex, and to which he sometimes
jokingly alludes. He rubs his chest and arms with
a tolerably hard brush. He afterwards gives the brush
to his valet de chambre, who rubs his back and shoulders,
and when in good humour he often says, “Come,
brush hard—as hard as if you were scrubbing an ass.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He used almost to drown himself in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>eau de Cologne</em></span>,
at least, so long as he had any at his disposal: but his
store of this article was speedily exhausted, and as none
could be procured on the island, he was reduced to the
necessity of using lavender water; the want of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>eau de
Cologne</em></span> he felt as a severe privation.</p>

<p class='c001'>After he has had his back rubbed, or after he has finished
shaving each side of his beard, he sometimes good-humouredly
looks his valet in the face for a few seconds,
and then gives him a smart box on the ear, accompanied
by some jocular expressions. This has been construed
by libelists and pamphleteers into the habit of cruelly
beating those who were about him. We all in our turns
occasionally received a pinch or a box on the ear; but
from the expressions which always accompanied the
action, we thought ourselves very happy in receiving
such favours during the period of his power.</p>

<p class='c001'>This calls to my recollection, and explains to me certain
observations which I once heard from the Duke
Decrès, one of the Emperor’s ministers. The Duke,
when in the height of his glory and power, wished to
obtain a certain favour from the Emperor. He was conversing
with me on the subject, and after adverting to
all his chances of success, he said: “I shall have it after
all, the first time I get roughly treated.” And, remarking
that my countenance expressed surprise, he added with
a significant smile: "But, my dear fellow, after all ’tis
not so terrible a thing as you imagine; many would be
happy to receive such usage, I assure you." ...</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor does not leave his chamber until he is
completely dressed. He wears shoes in the morning,
and does not put on his boots until he rides out on horseback.
When he first came to Longwood, he laid aside
his green uniform of the Guard, and wore a hunting coat
the lace of which had been taken off. This coat soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>began to look shabby, and his attendants were at a loss
what to substitute for it. This, however, was not the
only inconvenience of the kind to which he was exposed.
For instance, we were much distressed to see him reduced
to the necessity of wearing one pair of silk stockings
for several days in succession; but he laughed whenever
we expressed our regret on this subject, or remarked that
it was easy to count the number of days the stockings
had been worn, by the marks which the shoes had left
on them. In other respects he retained his usual dress;
namely, waistcoat and small clothes of white kerseymere,
and a black cravat. When he was going out, any one
of the gentlemen who happened to be in the room handed
to him his hat; that little hat which has in some measure
become identified with his person. Several of the
Emperor’s hats have been carried off since we have been
on the island; for every individual who approaches him
is anxious to obtain some token of remembrance of him.
How often have we been tormented even by persons of
distinguished rank, to procure for them even a button of
his coat or any other trifle belonging to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was almost always present at the Emperor’s toilet:
sometimes I remained after having finished my writing,
and sometimes the Emperor desired me to come and chat
with him. One day I was looking steadfastly at him as
he put on his flannel waistcoat. My countenance I suppose
expressed something particular, for he said in his
good humoured way of addressing me: “Well, what does
<em>your Excellency</em> smile at? What are you thinking of at
this moment.”—"Sire, in a pamphlet which I lately
read, I found it stated that your Majesty was shielded
by a coat of mail for the security of your person. A
report of the same kind was circulated among certain
classes in Paris; and in support of the assertion, allusion
was made to your Majesty’s sudden <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>embonpoint</em></span>,
which was said to be quite unnatural. I was just now
thinking that I could bear positive evidence to the contrary,
and that at St. Helena, at least, all precautions for
personal safety have been laid aside."—"This is one of
the thousand absurdities that have been published respecting
me," said he. "But the story you have just mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>is the more ridiculous, since every person about
me well knows how careless I am in regard to self-preservation.
Accustomed from the age of eighteen to be
exposed to cannon-balls, and knowing the inutility of
precautions, I abandoned myself to my fate. When I
came to the head of affairs, I might still have fancied
myself surrounded by the danger of the field of battle:
and I might have regarded the conspiracies that were
formed against me as so many bomb-shells. But I followed
my old course; I trusted to my lucky star; and
left all precautions to the police. I was perhaps the only
sovereign in Europe who dispensed with a body guard.
Every one could freely approach me without having, as
it were, to pass through military barracks; the sentinels
at the outer gates being passed, all had free access to
every part of my palace. Maria Louisa was much astonished
to see me so poorly guarded; and she often remarked
that her father was surrounded by bayonets.
For my part, I had no better defence at the Tuileries
than I have here: I don’t even know where to find my
sword; do you see it?" said he, looking about for it....
“I have, to be sure,” he continued, "incurred
great dangers. Upwards of thirty plots were formed
against me: these have been proved by authentic testimony,
without mentioning many that never came to
light. Some sovereigns invent conspiracies against
themselves; for my part, I made it a rule carefully to
conceal them whenever I could. The crisis most serious
to me was during the interval between the battle of
Marengo and the attempt of Georges, and the affair of
the Duke d’Enghien."</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon related that about a week before the arrest
of Georges, a petition had been delivered into his own
hands, on the parade, by one of the most determined of
the conspirators. Others insinuated themselves among
the household at St. Cloud or Malmaison; finally
Georges himself seems to have been so near his person
as to have been in the same apartment with him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Independently of good luck, the Emperor attributes
his safety, in a great measure, to certain circumstances
which were peculiar to himself. That which had doubtless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>he said, contributed to preserve him was his having
lived after his own fancy; without any regular habits or
fixed plan. His close occupations kept him much at
home, and almost constantly confined him to his closet.
He never dined abroad, seldom visited the theatres, and
never appeared but at those times and places at which
he was not expected.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we were descending to the garden after the Emperor
had finished dressing, he observed to me that the
two designs on his life which had placed him in the most
imminent danger were those of Cerachi the sculptor,
and the fanatic of Schönbrunn. Cerachi, and some other
desperate wretches, had laid a plan for assassinating the
First Consul. They agreed to carry their design into
execution at the moment of his withdrawing from his
box at the theatre. Napoleon, who received intimation
of the plot nevertheless proceeded to the theatre, and
fearlessly passed by the conspirators, who had shown
themselves most eager to occupy their respective stations.
They were not arrested until about the middle or near
the close of the performance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cerachi, said the Emperor, had formerly adored the
First Consul; but he vowed to sacrifice him, when, as
he pretended, he proved himself a tyrant. This artist
had been loaded with favours by General Bonaparte,
whose bust he had executed; and, when he entered into
the plot against his benefactor, he endeavoured by every
possible means to procure another sitting, under pretence
of making an essential improvement on the bust. Fortunately,
at that time, the Consul had not a single
moment’s leisure, and, thinking that want was the real
cause of the urgent solicitations of the sculptor, he sent
him six thousand francs. But how was he mistaken!
Cerachi’s real motive was to stab him during the sitting.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conspiracy was disclosed by a captain of the line,
who was himself an accomplice. “This,” said Napoleon,
“was a proof of the strange modifications of which the
human mind is susceptible, and shows to what lengths
the combinations of folly and stupidity may be carried!
This officer regarded me with horror as First Consul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>though he had adored me as a General. He wished to
see me driven from my post, but he rejected the idea of
any attempt upon my life. He wished that I should be
secured, but would not have me injured in any way;
and he proposed that I should be sent back to the army
to face the enemy and defend the glory of France. The
rest of the conspirators laughed at these notions; but,
when he found that they were distributing poniards
and going far beyond his intentions, he then came and
disclosed the whole to the Consul.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As we were discoursing on this subject, some one
present mentioned having witnessed at the Theatre
Feydeau, a circumstance which threw a part of the
audience into the greatest consternation. The Emperor
entered the Empress Josephine’s box, and had scarcely
taken his seat, when a young man hastily jumped upon
the bench immediately below the Box, and placed his
hand on the Emperor’s breast. The spectators on the
opposite side were filled with alarm. Fortunately,
however, the young man was merely presenting a petition,
which the Emperor received and read with the
utmost coolness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor described the <em>Fanatic of Schönbrunn</em>, as
the son of a protestant minister of Erfurt, who, about
the time of the battle of Wagram, had laid a plan for
the assassination of Napoleon, with all due parade. He
had passed the sentinels at some distance from the Emperor,
and had twice or thrice been driven back, when
General Rapp, in the act of pushing him aside with his
hand, felt something concealed under his coat. This
proved to be a knife about a foot and a half long, pointed,
and sharp at both edges. “I shuddered to look at it,”
said the Emperor; “it was merely rolled up in a piece
of newspaper.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon ordered the assassin to be brought into his
closet. He called Corvisart, and directed him to feel the
criminal’s pulse while he spoke to him. The assassin
stood unmoved, confessing his intended crime, and frequently
making quotations from the Bible. “What was
your purpose here?” enquired the Emperor. “To kill
you.” “What have I done to offend you? By whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>authority do you constitute yourself my Judge?”—"I
wish to put an end to the war." “And why not address
yourself to the Emperor Francis?” “To him!” said the
assassin, “and wherefore? he is a mere cipher. And
besides, if he were dead, another would succeed him;
but, when you are gone, the French will immediately
retire from Germany.” The Emperor vainly endeavoured
to move him. “Do you repent?” said he. “No.”
“Would you again attempt the perpetration of your
intended crime?” “Yes.” “What, if I were to pardon
you?” Here, said the Emperor, nature for an instant
resumed her sway; the man’s countenance and voice
underwent a momentary change. “Even though you
do,” said he, “God will not forgive me.” But he immediately
resumed his ferocious expression. He was
kept in solitary confinement and without food for four-and-twenty
hours. The Doctor examined him once
more. He was again questioned, but all was unavailing;
he still remained the same man, or, to speak more
properly, the same ferocious brute. He was at length
abandoned to his fate.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MEASURES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AFTER<br /> THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO.</h3>

<p class='c007'>3rd.—In the morning the Emperor dictated in the
shady part of the garden. The day was delightfully
clear and serene. He had been reading the account of
Alexander’s expedition in Rollin’s History; and had
several maps spread out before him. He complained
that the narrative was destitute of taste, and without
any proper plan. He observed that it afforded no
just idea of the grand views of Alexander; and he
expressed a wish himself to write an account of the
expedition.</p>

<p class='c001'>About five o’clock, I joined him in the garden, where
he was walking, attended by all the gentlemen. As soon
as he perceived me, he said: “Come, we must have
your opinion on a point which we have been discussing
for the last hour. On my return from Waterloo, do you
think I could have dismissed the Legislative Body, and
have saved France without it?”—"No," I replied, “it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>would not have been dissolved voluntarily. You would
have found it necessary to employ force; which would
have excited protestations, and would have been regarded
as scandalous. The dissatisfaction excited in the
Legislative Body would have spread through the whole
nation. Meanwhile the enemy would have arrived; and
your Majesty must have succumbed, accused by all
Europe, accused by foreigners, and even by Frenchmen;
perhaps loaded with universal maledictions, regarded
merely as an adventurer carrying every thing by violence.
But as it was, your Majesty issued pure and unsullied
from the conflict, and your memory will be everlastingly
cherished in the hearts of those who respect the cause
of the people. Your Majesty has, by your moderation,
ensured to yourself the brightest character in history,
while, by a different line of conduct, you might have
incurred the risk of reprobation. You have lost your
power, it is true; but you have attained the summit of
your glory.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, this is partly my own opinion,” said the
Emperor. "But after all, am I certain that the French
people will do me justice? Will they not accuse me of
having abandoned them? History will decide! Instead
of dreading, I invoke, its decree!—I have often asked
myself whether I have done for the French people all
that they could expect of me; for that people did much
for me. Will they ever know all that I suffered during
the night that preceded my final decision?</p>

<p class='c001'>"In that night of anguish and uncertainty, I had to
choose between two great courses: the one was to endeavour
to save France by violence; and the other was
to yield to the general impulse. The measure which I
pursued was, I think, most advisable. Friends and
enemies, the good and the evil disposed, all were against
me, and I stood alone. I could not but yield, and my
decision being once adopted, could not be revoked. I
am not one who takes half measures; and, besides,
sovereignty is not to be thrown off and on like one’s
cloak. The other course demanded extraordinary severity.
It would have been necessary to arraign great criminals
and to decree great punishments. Blood must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>shed; and then who can tell where we should have
stopped! What scenes of horror might not have been
renewed! By pursuing this line of conduct, should I not
have drowned my memory in the deluge of blood, crimes,
and abominations of every kind, with which libellers
have already overwhelmed me? Should I not thereby
have seemed to justify all that they have been pleased to
invent? Posterity and History would have viewed me as
a second Nero or Tiberius. If, after all, I could have
saved France at such a price!... I had energy
sufficient to carry me through every difficulty!...
But, is it certain that I should have succeeded? All
our dangers did not come from without; the worst
existed in our internal discord. Did not a party of mad
fools dispute about shades, before they had ensured the
triumph of the colour? How would it have been possible
to persuade them that I was not labouring for myself
alone, for my own personal advantage? How could I
convince them of my disinterestedness, or prove that all
my efforts were directed to save the country? To whom
could I point out the dangers and miseries from which I
sought to rescue the French people? They were evident
to me, but the vulgar mass will ever remain in ignorance
of them until they are crushed beneath their weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What answer could be given to those who exclaimed:
Behold the despot, the tyrant! again violating the oaths
which he took but yesterday! and who knows whether
amidst this tumult, this inextricable complication of difficulties,
I might not have perished by the hand of a
Frenchman, in the civil conflict! Then how would France
have appeared in the eyes of the universe, in the estimation
of future generations? The glory of France is to
identify herself with me. I could not have achieved so
many great deeds for her honour and glory without the
nation, and in spite of the nation. France was inclined
to elevate me to too high a point!... As I said
before, History will decide!...”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then adverted to the plan and details of the Campaign,
dwelling with pleasure on its glorious commencement,
and with regret on the terrible disaster that
marked its close.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Still,” continued he, "I should have considered the
state of affairs as by no means desperate, had I obtained
the aid I expected. All our resources rested in the
Chambers. I hastened to convince them of this; but
they immediately rose against me, under pretence that
I was come to dissolve them. What an absurdity!
From that moment all was lost.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“It would perhaps be unjust,” added the Emperor,
"to accuse the majority of the Members of the Chambers;
but such is the nature of all numerous bodies that
they must perish, if disunited. Like armies, they
must have leaders. The chiefs of armies are appointed;
but, in constituted bodies, men of eminent talent
and genius rise up and rule them. We wanted all
this, and, <a id='corr55.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='therfore'>therefore</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.15'><ins class='correction' title='therfore'>therefore</ins></a></span>, in spite of the good spirit which
might have animated the majority, all were, in
an instant, plunged into confusion and <a id='corr55.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tmulut'>tumult</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.17'><ins class='correction' title='tmulut'>tumult</ins></a></span>. The
Legislative Body had perfidy and corruption stationed at
its doors, while incapacity, disorder, and perversity prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in its bosom; and thus France became the prey of
foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'>"For a moment, I entertained the idea of resistance. I
was on the point of declaring myself permanently at the
Tuileries, along with my Ministers and Councillors of
State. I had thoughts of rallying round me the six
thousand guards who were in Paris, augmenting them
with the best disposed portion of the National Guard,
who were very numerous, and the federate troops of the
Faubourgs; of adjourning the Legislative Body to Tours
or Blois; re-organizing before the walls of Paris, the
wrecks of the army, and thus exerting my efforts singly,
as a Dictator, for the welfare of the country. But would
the Legislative Body have obeyed? I might have enforced
obedience, it is true; but this would have been a
new cause of scandal, and a fresh source of difficulties.
Would the people have made common cause with me?
Would even the army have continued constantly faithful
to me? In the succession of events, might not both the
people and the army have been separated from me?
Might not plans have been arranged to my prejudice?
The idea that so many dangers were caused by me alone
might have served as a plausible pretext, and the facilities
which every one had experienced during the preceding
year in gaining favour with the Bourbons, might
to many have become decisive inducements.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” continued the Emperor, "I hesitated long, I
weighed every argument on both sides; and I at length
concluded that I could not make head against the coalition
without and the royalists within: that I should be
unable to oppose the numerous sects which would have
been created by the violence committed on the Legislative
Body, to control that portion of the multitude which
must be driven by force, or to resist that moral condemnation
which imputes to him who is unfortunate every
evil that ensues. Abdication was therefore absolutely
the only step I could adopt. All was lost in spite of me.
I foresaw and foretold this: but still I had no other
alternative.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Allies always pursued the same system against
me. They began it at Prague, continued it at Frankfort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>at Chatillon, at Paris, and at Fontainbleau. Their conduct
displayed considerable judgment. The French
might have been duped in 1814; but it is difficult to
conceive how they could have been deceived in 1815.
History will for ever tarnish the memory of those who
suffered themselves to be misled. I foretold their fate
when I was departing to join the army: <em>Let us not resemble</em>,
I said, <em>the Greeks of the Lower Empire, who
amused themselves in debating while the battering-ram
was levelling the walls of their city</em>. And, when forced
to abdicate, I said, <em>Our enemies wish to separate me from
the army; when they shall have succeeded, they will
separate the army from you. You will then be merely a
wretched flock, the prey of wild beasts.</em>”</p>

<p class='c001'>We asked the Emperor whether he thought that, with
the concurrence of the Legislative Body, he could have
saved France? He replied, without hesitation, that he
would confidently have undertaken to do so, and that he
would have answered for his success.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In less than a fortnight,” continued he, "that is to
say, before any considerable mass of the allied force could
have assembled before Paris, I should have completed
my fortifications, and have collected before the walls
of the city, and out of the wrecks of the army, upwards
of eighty thousand good troops, and three hundred pieces
of horse artillery. After a few days’ firing, the national
guard, the federal troops, and the inhabitants of Paris,
would have sufficed to defend the entrenchments. I
should have had eighty thousand disposable troops at my
command. It is well known how advantageously I was
capable of employing this force.—The achievements of
1814 were still fresh in remembrance. Champaubert,
Montmirail, Craon, Montereau, were still present in the
imagination of our enemies; the same scenes would have
revived the recollection of the prodigies of the preceding
year. I was then surnamed the <em>hundred thousand men</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The rapidity and decision of our successes gave rise
to this name. The conduct of the French troops was
most admirable. Never did a handful of brave men
accomplish so many miracles. If their high achievements
have never been publicly known, owing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>circumstances which attended our disasters, they have at
least been duly appreciated by our enemies, who counted
the number of our attacks by our victories. We were
truly the heroes of fable!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Paris,” said he, "would in a few days have become
impregnable. The appeal to the nation, the magnitude
of the danger, the excitement of the public mind, the
grandeur of the spectacle, would have drawn multitudes
to the capital. I could undoubtedly have assembled upwards
of four hundred thousand men, and I imagine the
allied force did not exceed five hundred thousand. Thus
the affair would have been brought to a single combat,
in which the enemy would have had as much to fear as
ourselves. He would have hesitated, and thus I should
have regained the confidence of the majority.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meanwhile I should have surrounded myself with a
national senate or junta selected from among the members
of the Legislative Body—men distinguished by national
names, and worthy of general confidence. I should
have fortified my military Dictatorship with all the
strength of civil opinion. I should have had my tribune,
which would have promulgated the talisman of my principles
through Europe. The Sovereigns would have
trembled to behold the contagion spread among their
subjects. They must have treated with me, or have
surrendered....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, Sire,” we exclaimed, “why did you not attempt
what would infallibly have succeeded?—Why are we
here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now,” resumed the Emperor, “you are blaming
and condemning me! But, if you were to take a view
of the contrary chances, you would change your tone.
Besides, you forget that we reasoned on the hypothesis
that the Legislative Body would have joined me; but
you know what line of conduct it pursued. I might
have dissolved it, to be sure. France and Europe perhaps
blame me, and posterity will doubtless censure my
weakness, in not breaking up the Legislative Body after
its insurrection. It will be said, that I ought not to
have separated myself from the destinies of a people who
had done all for me. But by dissolving the Assembly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>I could at most have obtained only a capitulation from
the enemy. In that case, I again repeat, blood must have
been shed, and I must have proved myself a tyrant. I
had however arranged a plan on the night of the 20th,
and on the 21st measures of the most rigid severity were
to have been adopted; but before the return of day, the
dictates of humanity and prudence warned me that such
a course was not to be thought of, that I should miss my
aim, and that every one was merely seeking blindly to
accommodate himself to circumstances. But I must not
begin again. I have already said too much on a subject
which always revives painful recollections. I repeat
once more that History will decide.”—The Emperor returned
to his chamber desiring me to follow him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . .</p>

<p class='c001'>4th. At 5 o’clock I went to meet the Emperor in the
garden. He had taken too warm a bath, and in consequence
found himself ill. We rode out in the calash, the
weather was delightful: for several days it had been very
warm and dry. Before dinner the Emperor dictated to
the Grand Marshal. Madame Bertrand dined at the
Admiral’s. The Emperor withdrew to his chamber
immediately after dinner.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>5th—8th. During these four days, the Emperor invariably
rode out on horseback about six or seven in the
morning, accompanied only by me and my son.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am enabled to affirm that I never saw Napoleon
swayed either by passion or prejudice, that is to say, I
never knew him to pronounce a judgment on men and
things that was not dictated by reason. Even when he
displays what perhaps may be called anger, it is merely
the effect of transitory feeling, and never influences his
actions; but I can truly say that, during the eighteen
years in which I have had the opportunity of observing
his character, I never knew him to act in contradiction
to reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another fact which has come to my knowledge, and
which I note down here because it recurs to my memory
at this moment, is that, either from nature, calculation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>or the habit of preserving dignity, he for the most part
represses and conceals the painful sensations which he
experiences, and still more, perhaps, the kind emotions of
his heart. I have frequently observed him repressing
feelings of sensibility, as if he thought that they compromised
his character. Of this I shall hereafter adduce
proofs. Meanwhile, the following characteristic trait so
perfectly corresponds with the object of this journal,
namely, that of showing the man as he really is, and
seizing nature in the fact, that I cannot refrain from
mentioning it.</p>

<p class='c001'>For some days past, Napoleon seemed to have something
deeply at heart. A domestic circumstance which
had occurred vexed and ruffled him exceedingly. During
the last three days, in our rides about the park, he several
times alluded to this circumstance with considerable
warmth, desiring me to keep close by his side, and ordering
my son to ride on before. On one of these occasions
the following observation escaped him:—"I know
I am fallen. But to feel this among you!"... These
words, the gesture, the tone that accompanied them,
pierced my very heart. I was ready to throw myself at
his feet, and embrace his knees. “I know,” continued
he, “that man is frequently unreasonable and susceptible.
Thus, when I am mistrustful of myself, I asked, should
I have been treated so at the Tuileries? This is my sure
test.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then spoke of himself, of us, of our reciprocal relations,
of our situation in the island, and the influence
which our individual circumstances might enable us to
exercise. His reflections on these subjects were numerous,
powerful, and just. In the emotion with which this
conversation inspired me, I exclaimed: “Sire, permit
me to take this affair upon myself. It certainly never
could have been viewed in this light. If the matter were
explained, I am sure it would excite deep sorrow and repentance!
I only ask permission to say a single word.”
The Emperor replied with dignity:—"No, sir; I forbid
it. I have opened my heart to you. Nature has had
her course. I shall forget it; and you must seem never
to have known it."</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>On our return, we breakfasted all together in the garden,
and the Emperor was more than usually cheerful.
In the evening he dined in his own apartment.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>POLITICS.—THE STATE OF EUROPE.—IRRESISTIBLE<br /> ASCENDANCY OF LIBERAL OPINIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>9th-10th. On the 9th a ship arrived from England,
bringing papers to the 21st of January. The Emperor
continued his morning rides on horseback, and passed the
rest of the day in examining the newspapers in his own
chamber. The contents of these late papers were not
less interesting than those which we had already examined.
The agitation in France continued to increase; the
King of Prussia had issued proclamations respecting
secret societies; a misunderstanding had arisen between
Austria and Bavaria; in England the persecution of the
French Protestants, and the violence of the party which
was gaining the ascendancy, agitated the public mind,
and gave arms to the Opposition. Europe never presented
a more violent fermentation.</p>

<p class='c001'>On perusing the account of the deluge of evils and
sanguinary events which overwhelmed all the French
departments, the Emperor rose from his couch, and,
stamping his foot violently on the ground, he exclaimed!
“How unfortunate was I in not proceeding to America!
From the other hemisphere I might have protected France
against re-action! The dread of my re-appearance would
have been a check on their violence and folly. My name
would have sufficed to bridle their excesses, and to fill
them with terror.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, continuing the same subject, he said with a degree
of warmth, bordering on inspiration, "the counter-revolution,
even had it been suffered to proceed, must
inevitably have been lost in the grand revolution. The
atmosphere of modern ideas is sufficient to stifle the old
feudalists; for henceforth nothing can destroy or efface
the grand principles of our revolution. Those great and
excellent truths can never cease to exist, so completely
are they blended with our fame, our monuments, and our

the flood of glory, and they will henceforth be immortal.

blood of battles, adorned with the laurels of victory,
saluted with the acclamations of the people, sanctioned

Kings, these principles can never again retrograde!</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE EMPEROR’S OPINION OF SEVERAL CELEBRATED MEN.—POZZO DI BORGO—METTERNICH—BASSANO—CLARKE—CAMBACÉRÈS—LEBRUN—FOUCHÉ, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class='c007'>11th—12th. The Emperor took advantage of every
fine morning to ride on horseback. He breakfasted in
the garden; and the conversation was afterwards maintained
with great freedom and interest on the events of
his own private life, on public affairs, on the individuals
who surrounded his person, and those who have played
a conspicuous part in the other Courts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The English lessons were no longer thought of; they
were continued only in our rides or walks during the
day time. What the Emperor thus lost in grammatical
accuracy he gained in facility of expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>About five o’clock on the 11th, we took our usual
airing in the calash. In the evening we resumed our
ministerial anecdotes and conversations on celebrated
persons. Napoleon gave us the history of M. Pozzo di
Borgo, his countryman, who had been a Member of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Legislative Body. It was he, it is said, who advised
the Emperor Alexander to march upon Paris, even
though Napoleon should have attacked his rear. “And
thus,” said the Emperor, <a id='corr63.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='he'>“he</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_63.4'><ins class='correction' title='he'>“he</ins></a></span> decided the fate of France,
of European civilization, and the destinies of the whole
world. He had acquired great influence in the Russian
Cabinet."</p>

<p class='c001'>He also gave us the history of M. Capo d’Istria. He
then spoke of M. de Metternich.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor next spoke of his own Ministers; of
Bassano, whom he believed to have been sincerely attached
to him; Clarke, to whose character Time, he
said, would do ample justice; C.... whom late
events had shewn to have been worth but little. The
Emperor had successively appointed him Ambassador
to Vienna, Minister of the interior, and Minister for
foreign affairs. Talleyrand, observed the Emperor, described
his character in a word, when he said of him,
with his usual point and ill-natured spirit, that he was a
man who could make himself fit for any place on the
day before his appointment to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation next turned on M. Cambacérès,
whom Napoleon called the man of abuses; observing
that he had a decided inclination for the old regime.
Lebrun, on the contrary, had a predilection to the opposite
extreme. He, said the Emperor, was the man of
idealisms. These two men, he observed, were the counterpoises
between which the First Consul had placed
himself, and he in his turn was humourously called <em>the
consolidated third</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Messrs. de T.... and Fouché were next
spoken of. After saying a great deal respecting both,
the Emperor proceeded to make some energetic remarks
on the morality of individuals connected with the ministry
in France, and generally of all functionaries or men
in office; on their want of political faith, or national
feeling, which led them to serve indifferently one person
to-day, and another to-morrow. “This levity, this inconsistency,”
said he, “has descended to us from antiquity.
We still remain Gauls, and our character will
never be complete, until we learn to substitute principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>for turbulence, pride for vanity, and, above all, the love
of institutions for the love of place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor concluded that, at the close of our late
events, the Monarchs of Europe must necessarily have
retained a retrospective feeling of scorn and contempt
for the great people who had thus sported with Sovereignty.
“But,” said he, “the excuse may perhaps be
found in the nature of things, and in the power of circumstances.
Democracy raises up Sovereignty, aristocracy
preserves it. Mine had neither taken a root
deep enough, nor acquired sufficient spirit. At the
moment of the crisis it was still connected with democracy;
and it mingled with the multitude instead of becoming
the sheet-anchor to secure the people from the
fury of the tempest, and to guide them in their blindness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following are some fresh particulars respecting
M. de T—— and M. Fouché, whose names
have so frequently been mentioned. I endeavour as
much as possible to avoid repetitions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“M. de T——” said the Emperor, “waited
two days and nights at Vienna for full powers to treat for
peace in my name; but I should have been ashamed to
have thus prostituted my policy; and yet, perhaps, my
conduct in this instance has purchased my exile to St.
Helena; for I cannot but allow that T——
is a man of singular talent, and capable at all times of
throwing great weight into the scale.</p>

<p class='c001'>“T——” continued he, “was always in a
state treason; but it was in partnership with fortune. His
circumspection was extreme; he treated his friends as if
they might in future become his enemies; and he behaved
to his enemies as if they might some time or other
become his friends. M. de T—— had always
been, in my opinion, hostile to the Faubourg St.
Germain. In the affair of the divorce, he was for the
Empress Josephine. It was he who urged the war with
Spain, though in public he had the art to appear averse
to it.” Thus it was from a kind of spite that Napoleon
made choice of Valencey as the residence of Ferdinand.
“In short,” said the Emperor, “T——
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>was the principal instrument and the active cause of the
death of the Duke d’Enghien.”</p>

<div id='i064b'  class='figcenter id001'>

<p>Ch. Maurice de Talleyrand<br /><br /><span class='small'>Engraved by Thomson, from the Original Painting by F. Gérard</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon observed that a celebrated actress (Mademoiselle
Raucourt) had described him with great truth.
“If you ask him a question,” said she, “he is an iron chest,
whence you cannot extract a syllable; but if you ask
him nothing, you will soon be unable to stop his mouth—he
will become a regular gossip.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was a foible which, at the outset, destroyed the
confidence of the Emperor, and made him waver in his
opinion of T——. “I had entrusted him,” said
Napoleon, "with a very important affair, and, a few
hours afterwards, Josephine related it to me word for
word. I instantly sent for the Minister, to inform him
that I had just learned from the Empress a circumstance
which I had told in confidence to himself alone. The
story had already passed through four or five intermediate
channels.</p>

<p class='c001'>"T——’s countenance," added the Emperor,
“is so immoveable that nothing can ever be read in it.
Lannes and Murat used jokingly to say of him that if,
while he was speaking to you, some one should come
behind him and give him a kick, his countenance would
betray no indication of the affront.”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. de T—— is mild and even endearing in his
domestic habits. His servants, and the persons in his
employment, are attached and devoted to him. Among
his intimate friends he willingly and good-humouredly
speaks of his ecclesiastical profession. He one day expressed
his dislike of a tune which was hummed in his
hearing. He said he had a great horror of it; it reminded
him of the time when he was obliged to practise
church-music, and to sing at the desk. On another occasion,
one of his intimate friends was telling a story
during supper, while M. de T—— was engaged
in thought, and seemed inattentive to the conversation.
In the course of the story, the speaker happened to say
in a lively manner of some one whom he had named,
“That fellow is a comical rogue; he is a married priest.”
T——, roused by these words, seized a spoon,
plunged it hastily into the dish before him, and with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>threatening aspect called out to him, “Mr. Such-a-one,
will you have some spinach?” The person who was
telling the story was confounded, and all the party burst
into a fit of laughter, M. de T—— as well as
the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, at the time of the Concordat, wished
to have made M. de T.... a Cardinal, and to
have placed him at the head of ecclesiastical affairs. He
told him that his proper destiny was to return to the
bosom of the Church, to refresh his memory, and to
stop the mouths of the declaimers. T——, however,
would never agree to this; his aversion to the
ecclesiastical profession was insurmountable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon was very near appointing him Ambassador
to Warsaw, a dignity which he subsequently conferred
on the Abbé de Pradt; but his dirty stock-jobbing
tricks, as the Emperor called them, occasioned this intention
to be abandoned. The Emperor was induced by
the same reasons, and at the instance of several sovereigns
of Germany, to deprive him of the portfolio of
Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor remarked that Fouché was the T——
of the clubs, and that T—— was the Fouché of the
drawing-rooms. “Intrigue,” he said, "was to Fouché
a necessary of life. He intrigued at all times, in all
places, in all ways, and with all persons. Nothing ever
came to light but he was found to have had a hand in
it. He made it his sole business to look out for something
that he might be meddling with. His mania was
to wish to be concerned in every thing...! Always
in every body’s shoes." This the Emperor would often
repeat.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of the conspiracy of Georges, when
Moreau was arrested, Fouché was no longer at the head
of the Police, and he endeavoured to make himself very
much regretted. “What stupidity!” said he, “they
have arrested Moreau when he was returning to Paris
from his country residence, a circumstance which at least
appeared like the confidence of innocence. On the contrary,
he should have been seized when he went to
Gros-Bois, for then he was evidently running away.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The remark which he made, or which is attributed to
him on the affair of the Duke d’Enghien, is well known;
“It is more than a crime, it is a fault,” said he. Such
traits as these paint the character of a man better than
whole volumes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor knew Fouché well, and never became
his dupe. He has been much blamed for having employed
him in 1815, when indeed Fouché basely betrayed
him. Napoleon was not ignorant of his disposition;
but he also knew that the danger depended more on the
circumstances than on the individual. “If I had been
victorious,” said he, “Fouché would have been faithful.
He took great care, it is true, to hold himself in readiness
for whatever might happen. I ought to have
conquered!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, however, was acquainted with his underhand
dealings, and he did not spare <a id='corr67.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='him'>him.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.17'><ins class='correction' title='him'>him.</ins></a></span> After Napoleon’s
return in 1815, one of the first bankers of Paris
presented himself at the Elysée, to inform him that, a
few days previously, a person just arrived from Vienna
had waited upon him with letters of credit, and had made
enquiries respecting the means by which he could meet
with Fouché. Whether from reflection or presentiment,
the banker conceived some doubts respecting this individual,
and accordingly came to communicate them in
person to the Emperor, who was astonished that Fouché
had concealed the matter from his knowledge. In the
course of a few hours Réal found the person in question,
and immediately brought him to the Elysée, where he
was shut up in a small room by himself. The Emperor
ordered him to be brought into the garden. “Do you
know me?” said he to the man. This commencement,
and the feelings which the Emperor’s presence inspired,
greatly startled the stranger. “I am acquainted with
all your proceedings,” continued Napoleon, in a tone of
severity: “if you this moment confess all you know, I
may pardon you; if not, you will be taken from this
garden to be shot.”—"I will tell all," said the man.
“I am sent hither by M. de Metternich to the Duke of
Otranto, to propose that he will despatch a messenger to
Bâle, who will there meet the messenger sent by M. de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Metternich from Vienna. These,” continued he, delivering
some papers, “are the marks of recognition
which they are to possess.”—"Have you executed your
mission to Fouché?" enquired the Emperor.—"Yes."—"Has
he despatched his messenger?"—"I do not
know." The man was put under confinement, and within
an hour a confidential person (M. F——) was on
the road to Bâle. He introduced himself to the
Austrian messenger, and even held four conferences
with him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile Fouché, who was uneasy at the non-appearance
of his Vienna messenger, one day waited on
the Emperor, and attempted with an air of gaiety and
cheerfulness to conceal his extreme embarrassment.
“There were several looking-glasses,” said the Emperor,
“in the apartment, and I was much amused in
studying him by stealth; the expression of his countenance
was hideous; he did not know how to enter upon
the subject which interested him so deeply.”—"Sire,"
said he at length, <a id='corr68.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='a circumstance'>"a circumstance</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.19'><ins class='correction' title='a circumstance'>"a circumstance</ins></a></span> occurred to me four or
five days ago, which I fear I was wrong in not communicating
to your Majesty.... But I have so much
business on my hands——I am surrounded with so
many reports, so many intrigues——. A man came to
me from Vienna with most ridiculous propositions,——and
he is now no where to be found!"—"M. Fouché,"
said the Emperor, “you may injure yourself, if you take
me for a fool. I have secured the man you speak of, and
I have known the whole intrigue for several days. Have
you sent to Bâle?”—"No, Sire."—"That is fortunate
for you. If it be otherwise, and I obtain proofs of it,
it may cost you your life."</p>

<p class='c001'>Subsequent events have proved that this would have
been but justice. It appears, however, that Fouché had
not sent, and here the business ended.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>PAPERS FROM EUROPE.—POLITICAL REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>13th.—The Emperor breakfasted in the garden, and
sent for us all to attend him. He resumed the reading
of the papers which we had glanced at in the morning,
and then proceeded to expatiate on political affairs. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>following observations are those which most forcibly
struck me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the 13th Vendemiaire, the inhabitants of Paris
were completely disgusted with the Government,” said
the Emperor; "but the whole of the army, the great
majority of the population of the departments, the lower
class of citizens, and the peasantry, remained attached to
it. Thus the Revolution triumphed over this grand
attack of the counter-revolution, though it was only four
or five years since the new principles had been promulgated.
The most frightful and calamitous scenes
had been witnessed; and a happier future was anticipated.</p>

<p class='c001'>"But now how altered is the case!... If the
soldier in his barracks seeks to while away the tedious
hours in talking of battles, he cannot speak of Fontenoy
or Prague, which he did not witness; he must speak of
the victories of Marengo, Austerlitz, and Jena; of him
who gained them; in short, of me, whose fame fills
every mouth, and lives in every heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Such a situation is unexampled in history. On
whichever side it is viewed, nothing but misfortunes present
themselves. What will be the result of this?...
Two classes of people, inhabitants of the same soil, will
become mortal, irreconcileable enemies, will be incessantly
quarrelling, and will, perhaps, finally exterminate
each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same fury will soon spread through Europe.
The whole Continent will be composed of two hostile
parties; it will be no longer divided by nations and territories,
but by party-colours and opinions. Who can
foresee the crisis, the duration, the details of so many
troubles! The event cannot be doubtful. The present
enlightened age will not retrograde in knowledge!...
How unfortunate was my fall!... I had imprisoned
the winds; but bayonets have released them. I could
have proceeded tranquilly in the universal regeneration,
which can henceforth be effected only amidst storms!
My object was to amalgamate; others, perhaps, will
extirpate!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>THE GOVERNOR’S ARRIVAL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>14th.—The rainy weather had returned; for two days it
had been miserably wet. Some vessels appeared in
sight; and we learnt by signals that they brought the
new Governor, Sir Hudson Lowe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was silent and melancholy during dinner.
He was not well, and he retired very early.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE EMPEROR’S PROGRESS IN LEARNING ENGLISH.</h3>

<p class='c007'>15th.—About 12 o’clock this morning I received four
letters from Europe, which rendered me as happy as I
could possibly be in this place.</p>

<p class='c001'>I saw the Emperor at five o’clock in the garden. He
had taken advantage of an interval of fine weather; the
rain had been pouring the whole day. I communicated
to him the contents of my letters. All our party had
received communications from Europe. They were delivered
to us open, and they contained no news; but they
proved that our friends still remembered us, and in our
situation such an assurance was peculiarly gratifying.</p>

<p class='c001'>During dinner, the Emperor described to us the contents
of some French papers which he had by him, and
which, he said, gave an account of the shipwreck of La
Perouse, his different adventures; his death, and his journal.
The narrative consisted of the most curious, striking,
and romantic details, and interested us exceedingly.
The Emperor observed how highly our curiosity was
excited, and then burst into a fit of laughter. This story
was nothing but an impromptu of his own, which he said
he had invented merely to show us the progress he had
made in English.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE GOVERNOR’S FIRST VISIT.—DECLARATION<br /> REQUIRED FROM US.</h3>

<p class='c007'>16th.—The new Governor arrived at Longwood about
ten o’clock, notwithstanding the rain which still continued.
He was accompanied by the Admiral, who was
to introduce him, and who had, no doubt, told him that
this was the most suitable hour for his visit. The Emperor
did not receive him; he was indisposed, and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>had he been well, he would not have seen him. The
Governor, in this abrupt visit, neglected the usual forms
of decorum. It was easy to perceive that this was a
trick of the Admiral’s. The Governor, who probably
had no intention to render himself at all disagreeable,
appeared very much disconcerted. We laughed in our
sleeves. As for the Admiral, he was quite triumphant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor, after long hesitation and very evident
marks of ill-humour, took his leave rather abruptly.
We doubted not that this visit had been planned by the
Admiral, with the view of prepossessing us against each
other at the very outset. But whether the Governor
himself had any concern in it, or entertained any suspicion
of its design, is a question which time will
decide.</p>

<p class='c001'>About half-past five, the Emperor sent for me to attend
him in the garden. He was alone. He told me
that a circumstance had arisen which regarded us all
individually. It had been determined to require a declaration
from each of us, stating whether we chose rather
to unite our fate with that of the Emperor, or to be
removed from St. Helena and set at liberty.</p>

<p class='c001'>We could not guess the motive of this determination.
Was it adopted by the English Ministry for the sake of
procuring regular documents? But at the time of our
departure from Plymouth, this preliminary condition was
perfectly understood. Was it hoped by this means to
separate the Emperor more completely from the world?
But could it ever be supposed that we would forsake
him?</p>

<p class='c001'>He asked what would be my determination on this
point. I replied that it could not be for a moment
doubtful; that if I ever felt a pang, it must have been
at the moment of my first determination; that from that
instant my fate had been irrevocably fixed. I had at
first obeyed only the dictates of glory and honour; but
in every succeeding day I had indulged my natural affection
and feelings. The Emperor’s voice assumed a
milder tone; and this was the mode in which he expressed
his thanks. I knew his heart, and the full extent
of his gratitude.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>I added that there was but little merit in my resolution.
No change could take place in our situations.
The day after having signed the document, we should
be the same as we had been the day before. Our fate
depended not on human combinations, but on the course
of events. It would be very unwise to add to our
troubles by calculations beyond the reach of human
foresight. It is our duty calmly to resign ourselves to
the mysterious decrees of Fate; and, in the depth of our
misfortune, to comfort ourselves with the reflection that
our minds are free from self-reproach. This is a consolation
which it is beyond the power of man to enfeeble
or to destroy.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CHARACTERISTIC CONVERSATION.—THE EMPEROR’S RETURN FROM ELBA FORESEEN AT THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU.—THE GOVERNOR’S INTRODUCTION.—MORTIFICATION EXPERIENCED BY THE ADMIRAL.—OUR CAUSES OF COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM.—DESCRIPTION OF SIR HUDSON LOWE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>17th.—The Emperor sent for me at nine o’clock. He
read to me an article in the Portsmouth Courier, which
gave a very long and faithful description of his residence
at Briars.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sent for me again in the middle of the day to
converse with him. One part of the conversation affords
so valuable a development of Napoleon’s character that
I cannot refrain from noting down some passages
of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There occasionally arose among us transient misunderstandings
and disputes, which vexed and annoyed
the Emperor. He adverted to this topic. He analysed
our situation with his usual train of reasoning. He
calculated the miseries and horrors of our exile, and
pointed out the best mode of alleviating them. He said
that we ought to make mutual sacrifices, and overlook
many grievances; that man can only enjoy life by controlling
the character given to him by nature, or by
creating to himself a new one by education, and learning
to modify it according to the obstacles which he may
encounter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“You should endeavour to form but one family,”
said he. “You have followed me only with the view of
assuaging my sorrow. Ought not this feeling to subdue
every other consideration? If sympathy alone is not
sufficiently powerful, let reason be your guide. You
should learn to calculate your sorrows, your sacrifices,
and your enjoyments, in order to arrive at a result, just
as we make additions or subtractions in every kind of
calculation. All the circumstances of our lives should
be submitted to this rule.... We must learn to conquer
ill temper. It is natural enough that little misunderstandings
should arise among you; but they should
be followed by explanation, and not succeeded by ill-humour;
the former will produce a result, the latter will
only render the affair more complicated. Reason and
logical inference should, in this world, be our constant
guides.” He then proceeded to show how he had sometimes
acted up to these principles, and sometimes departed
from them. He added that we ought to learn
to forgive, and to avoid that hostility and acrimony
which must be offensive to our neighbours and prejudicial
to our own happiness; that we ought to make
allowance for human frailties, and humour, rather than
oppose, them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What would have become of me,” said he, "had I
not followed these maxims? It has often been said
that I have been too good-natured, and not sufficiently
cautious; but it would have been much worse for me
had my disposition been the reverse of what it is. I
have been twice betrayed, it is true; and I may be betrayed
a third time. But it was my knowledge of human
character, and the spirit of reasonable indulgence which
I had adopted, that enabled me to govern France; and
which still perhaps render me the fittest person to rule
that nation, under existing circumstances. On my
departure from Fontainebleau, did I not say to all who
requested me to point out the line of conduct they should
pursue, ‘Go, and serve the King!’ I wished to grant
them lawful authority for doing what many would not
have hesitated to do of their own accord. I would not
allow the fidelity of some to be the cause of their ruin;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and finally, above all, I did not wish to have any one to
censure on my return."</p>

<p class='c001'>I here ventured, contrary to my constant custom, to
call the Emperor, in some measure, to account. “How,
Sire,” I exclaimed, “had your Majesty any idea of returning
when you left Fontainbleau?”—"Yes, certainly,
and by the simplest reasoning. If the Bourbons, said
I, intend to commence a fifth dynasty, I have nothing
more to do here; I have acted my part. But, if they
should obstinately attempt to re-continue the third, I shall
soon appear again. It may be said that the Bourbons
then had my fame and conduct at their own disposal.
It was in their power still to represent me in the eyes of
the common mass of mankind as an upstart, a tyrant, a
fire-brand, and a scourge. How much good sense and
calm reflection would have been necessary to appreciate
my real character, and render me justice!... But the
men by whom the Bourbons were surrounded, and the
erroneous line of conduct they pursued, rendered my
presence desirable; they restored my popularity and
decreed my return. I should otherwise have ended my
days on the Island of Elba, and this would doubtless
have proved most to the interest of all parties. I returned
to discharge a great debt, and not for the sake of
resuming possession of a throne. Perhaps few will
comprehend the motive by which I was actuated; no
matter. I took upon myself a heavy charge, but it was
a duty I owed to the French people. Their complaints
reached me; and how could I turn a deaf ear to them?</p>

<p class='c001'>"Upon the whole, my situation in the Island of Elba
was sufficiently enviable and agreeable. I should soon
have created to myself a new kind of sovereignty. All
that was most distinguished in Europe began to pass in
review before me. I should have presented a spectacle
unknown in history: that of a monarch who had descended
from his throne, beholding the civilized world
thronging to file off before him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may indeed be objected that the Allies would have
removed me from my Island; and I admit that this
circumstance hastened my return. But had France been
wisely governed, had the French people been content
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>my influence would have ended; I should henceforth
have belonged only to history, and the cabinet of Vienna
would have entertained no idea of deposing me. It was
the agitation created and maintained in France that first
gave rise to the thought of my removal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Grand Marshal entered the Emperor’s
apartment. He came to announce the arrival of the
Governor, who was escorted by the Admiral, and followed
by the whole of his staff.</p>

<p class='c001'>After some further conversation, Bertrand was left
alone with the Emperor, and I proceeded to the antechamber;
here all the suite was assembled. We endeavoured
to exchange a few words with each other; but
we were rather bent on observing than conversing.</p>

<p class='c001'>In about half an hour, the Emperor entered the drawing-room.
The valet-de-chambre on duty, who was
stationed at the door within the apartment, then summoned
the Governor, and he was introduced. The Admiral
was following close behind him. The valet who
had heard only the Governor’s name mentioned, suddenly
closed the door without admitting the Admiral,
who was shut out in spite of his remonstrance; and
he withdrew quite disconcerted into the recess of
one of the windows. The valet de chambre who was
the cause of this affront, was Noverraz, a Swiss, a
good and faithful servant, of whom the Emperor frequently
said that his whole understanding was absorbed
in his attachment to his master.</p>

<p class='c001'>We were astonished at this unexpected occurrence;
and we at first concluded that Noverraz had acted in
obedience to the Emperor’s wishes. Though we had
ample reason to complain of the Admiral, yet we did all
in our power to relieve him from his embarrassment; his
awkward situation distressed us. Meanwhile the Governor’s
staff was summoned and introduced; and this circumstance
served only to increase the Admiral’s confusion.
In about a quarter of an hour the Emperor took
leave of his visitors. The Governor came out of the drawing-room,
and the Admiral eagerly advanced to meet him.
They said a few words to each other with some degree
of warmth, then took leave of us and departed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>We joined the Emperor in the garden, and our conversation
turned on the Admiral’s discomfiture. The
Emperor knew nothing of the matter. The whole circumstance
was solely the effect of chance. The Emperor
declared himself delighted with the joke. He burst
into a fit of laughter, rubbed his hands, and exhibited
the joy of a child, of a school-boy, who had successfully
played off a trick on his master. “Ah! my good Noverraz,”
said he, “you have done a clever thing for once in
your life. He had heard me say that I would not see the
Admiral again, and he thought he was bound to shut
the door in his face. But this honest Swiss may perhaps
carry the joke too far; if I were unfortunately to say we
must get rid of the Governor, he would be for assassinating
him before my eyes. After all,” said the Emperor,
assuming a more serious tone, "it was entirely the Governor’s
fault. He should have requested that the Admiral
might be admitted, particularly as he had informed
me that he could be presented only by him. Why,
again, did he not request the Admiral’s admission when
he presented his officers to me? He is solely to blame.
But," continued he, “the Admiral has lost nothing by
the mistake. I should without hesitation have apostrophized
him in the presence of his countrymen. I should
have told him that by the sentiment attached to the
honourable uniform which we had both worn for forty
years, I accused him of having, in the eyes of the world,
degraded his nation and his Sovereign by wantonly and
stupidly failing in respect to one of the oldest soldiers in
Europe. I should have reproached him with landing
me at St. Helena just as he would have landed a convict
at Botany-Bay. I should have assured him that a man
of true honour would shew me more respect on my rock
than if I were still on my throne and surrounded by my
armies.” The force and spirit of these remarks put a
period to our gaiety, and closed the conversation.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I have thus alluded to the Admiral, and as he is
now about to quit us, I will once for all sum up the insults
with which we have to reproach him, with as much
impartiality as our situation and the state of our feelings
will admit of.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>We cannot pardon the affected familiarity with which
he treated us, though our conduct afforded but little
encouragement to it. Still less can we forgive him for
having endeavoured to extend this familiarity to the
Emperor. We can never forget the haughty and self-complacent
air with which he addressed Napoleon by the
title of <em>General</em>. The Emperor, it is true, has immortalized
that title; but the tone and the intention with
which it was applied were sufficiently insulting.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our arrival at St. Helena, he lodged the Emperor
in a little room, a few feet square, where he kept him
for two months, though other residences could have been
procured, and there was one which the Admiral had
himself fixed upon. He indirectly prohibited the Emperor
from riding on horseback, even in the grounds
surrounding the Briars; and the individuals of the Emperor’s
suite were loaded with embarrassments and humiliations,
when they came to pay their daily visits to him
in his little cell.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our removal to Longwood, he stationed sentinels
under the very windows of the Emperor; and then, by
an evasion, which savoured of the bitterest irony, he alleged
that this step had been taken only with a view to
the <em>General’s</em> own advantage and protection. He suffered
no one to come near us without a note from him, and,
having thus placed us in close confinement, he declared
that these arrangements had been made solely to secure
the Emperor against importunity, and that he (the Admiral)
was merely acting the part of <em>Grand Marshal</em>.
He gave a ball, and sent a written invitation to <em>General
Buonaparte</em>, in the same manner as he did to every
individual in the suite. He replied with the most unbecoming
jeers to the notes of the Grand Marshal, who
used the title of <em>Emperor</em>, saying that he knew no <em>Emperor</em>
at the Island of St. Helena, nor any such Sovereign
in Europe, or elsewhere, who was not in his own
dominions. He refused to forward a letter from the
Emperor to the Prince Regent, unless it were delivered
to him open, or he were permitted to read it. He even
stifled the sentiments and expressions of respect which
other individuals manifested for Napoleon. We were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>assured that he had put persons in inferior situations
under arrest, merely for having used the title of Emperor
or other similar expressions; which, however, were
frequently employed in the 53rd regiment, doubtless, as
the Emperor observed, through an irresistible sentiment
with which these brave men were inspired.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Admiral, from his own personal caprice, had
limited the extent of our rides and walks. On this subject
he had even broken his word to the Emperor. At
a moment when he appeared somewhat inclined to make
concessions, he had assured Napoleon that he was free
to ride in all parts of the Island, without being annoyed
even by the sight of the English officer appointed to
guard him. But a few days after this, just as Napoleon
was on the point of mounting his horse to ride out to
breakfast in a shady spot at some distance from our
residence, he found himself under the necessity of renouncing
this little enjoyment. The officer declared
that he must henceforth form one of the party and ride
close to him. From that moment the Emperor refused
to see the Admiral. The latter had moreover neglected
the most ordinary forms of decorum, always fixing upon
unsuitable hours for his own visits, and directing strangers
who arrived at the Island to select the same unseasonable
periods for visiting the Emperor. This was no
doubt done with a view of preventing people from gaining
access to Napoleon, who constantly refused to be seen
on these occasions. It has already been stated that the
Admiral acted thus when the Governor paid his first
visit to Longwood; and the satisfaction he evinced at
the Governor’s ill reception but too plainly betrayed his
design.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, if we were required to pronounce an impartial
opinion on him, making allowance for the irritability
of our own feelings and the delicacy of his situation,
we should not hesitate to declare that our grievances
rested in forms rather than facts. We should say, with
the Emperor, who had after all a natural predilection for
him, that Admiral Cockburn is far from being an ill-disposed
man, that he is even susceptible of generous
and delicate sentiment; but that he is capricious, irascible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>vain, and overbearing: that he is a man who is
accustomed to authority, and who exercises it ungraciously;
frequently substituting energy for dignity. To
express in a few words the nature of our relations with
respect to him, we should say, that, as a jailor, he was
mild, humane, and generous, and that we have reason to
be grateful to him; but that, as a host, he was generally
unpolite, often something worse, and that in this character
we have cause to be displeased with him.</p>

<p class='c001'>About two or three o’clock, the Emperor took his
usual airing. During our walk in the garden and our
ride in the calash, he said a good deal about the events
of the morning; and the conversation on this subject
was resumed after dinner. Some one jokingly observed
that the two first days of the Governor’s arrival had
been like days of battle, and were calculated to make us
appear very untractable, though we were naturally most
patient and accommodating. At these last words, the
Emperor smiled and pinched the ear of the individual
who made the remark.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation then turned on Sir Hudson Lowe.
He was described as being a man about forty-five years
of age; of the ordinary height, and of slender make,
with red hair, a ruddy complexion, and freckled. His
eyes were said to have an oblique kind of expression;
glancing askance, seldom fixed full in a person’s face;
surmounted by fair, bushy, and very prominent eyebrows.
“He is hideous,” said the Emperor, "he has a most
villainous countenance. But we must not decide too
hastily; the man’s disposition may perhaps make amends
for the unfavorable impression which his face produces;
this is not impossible."</p>

<h3 class='c006'>CONVENTION OF THE SOVEREIGNS RESPECTING NAPOLEON.—REMARKABLE<br /> OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>18th. The weather had been horrible for some days
past, but it cleared up a little to-day. The Emperor
went out early to take his walk in the garden; about
4 o’clock he got into the calash and took rather a
longer airing than usual. Before dinner the Emperor
desired me to translate to him the Convention of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Allied Sovereigns relative to his captivity. It was as
follows:—</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CONVENTION BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN, AUSTRIA, PRUSSIA, AND RUSSIA.—<em>Signed at Paris, August 20th, 1815.</em></h3>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c007'>"Napoleon Bonaparte being in the power of the
Allied Sovereigns, their Majesties the King of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Emperor of
Austria, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of Prussia,
have agreed, by virtue of the stipulations of the treaty
of the 25th of March, 1815, on the measures best calculated
to preclude the possibility of his making any
attempt to disturb the peace of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. I.—Napoleon Bonaparte is considered by the
Powers who signed the treaty of the 20th of March last,
as their prisoner.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. II.—His safeguard is specially intrusted to the
British Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The choice of the place and the measures which may
best ensure the object of the present stipulation, are reserved
to his Britannic Majesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. III.—The imperial courts of Austria and Russia
and the Royal court of Prussia shall appoint Commissioners
to reside in the place which his Britannic Majesty’s
Government shall assign as the residence of
Napoleon Bonaparte, and who, without being responsible
for his security, shall assure themselves of his presence.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. IV.—His most Christian Majesty is invited in
the name of the four Courts above mentioned, also to
send a French commissioner to the place of Napoleon
Bonaparte’s detention.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. V. <a id='corr80.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='His'>—His</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_80.31'><ins class='correction' title='His'>—His</ins></a></span> Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland pledges himself to fulfil
the engagements assigned to him by the present convention.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Art. VI.—The present convention shall be ratified,
and the ratification shall be exchanged in the space of a
fortnight, or sooner if possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In virtue of which the respective Plenipotentiaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>have signed the present convention, and have affixed
their seals thereto.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Given at Paris on the 20th of August, in the year
of our Lord 1815.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>When I had finished translating this document, the
Emperor asked me what I thought of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” I replied, "in the situation in which we are
placed, I would rather depend on the interests of a single
one, than on the complicated decision of four. England
has evidently dictated this treaty. You see how carefully
she stipulates that she alone shall answer for and
dispose of the prisoner. She has been labouring to provide
herself with the lever of Archimedes, and therefore
it is not probable that she w¡ll entertain any idea of
breaking it."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, without explaining his ideas on this subject,
adverted to the different chances which might bring
about his liberation from St. Helena, and he made the
following remarkable observations: “If the Sovereigns
of Europe act wisely, and should succeed in completely
restoring order, we shall not be worth the money and the
trouble which it must cost to keep us here, and they will
get rid of us. But our captivity may still be prolonged
for some years, perhaps three, four, or five. Otherwise,
setting aside the fortuitous events which are beyond the
reach of human foresight, I calculate only on two uncertain
chances of our liberation: first, that the Sovereigns
may stand in need of me to assist in putting down
rebellion among their subjects; and secondly, the people
of Europe may require my aid in the contest that may
arise between them and their monarchs. I am the natural
arbiter and mediator in the immense conflict between
the present and the past. I have always aspired
to be the supreme judge in this cause. My administration
at home and my diplomacy abroad all tended to this
great end. The issue might have been brought about
more easily and promptly; but fate ordained otherwise.
Finally, there is a last chance, which perhaps is the most
probable of all; I may be wanted to check the power of
the Russians; for, in less than ten years, all Europe may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>perhaps be overrun with Cossacks, or subject to republican
government. Such however are the statesmen who
brought about my overthrow.” Then, reverting to the
decision of the Sovereigns respecting him, he observed
that it was difficult to account for the style of the document,
and the malignant spirit which pervaded it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Emperor Francis,” said he, “is a pious sovereign,
and I am his son-in-law.—As for Alexander, we
once loved each other. With regard to the King of
Prussia, I doubtless did him much harm, but I might
have done him much more; and after all, might he not
have found real glory and self-satisfaction in distinguishing
himself by generosity? As to England, it is to the
animosity of her Ministers that I am indebted for all.
But it remained for the Prince Regent to observe and
interfere, or to be branded as a fool, and a protector of
vulgar malignity.—One thing however is certain, namely:
that the Allied Sovereigns have compromised, degraded,
and lost themselves, by their treatment of me.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE DECLARATION REQUIRED FROM US BY THE<br /> GOVERNOR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>19th.—This morning the Grand Marshal and Madame
Bertrand came into the garden, in consequence of the
Emperor having expressed an intention of breakfasting
there; but as he had passed a very restless night, and
had had no sleep, he breakfasted in his chamber.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor gave us official notice that we must
each send him a declaration, expressing our voluntary
determination to remain at Longwood, and to submit to
all the restrictions which Napoleon’s captivity might
require. Mine was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Declaration.</em>—"I, the undersigned, repeat the declaration
which I made when in Plymouth-roads; namely,
that I wish to devote myself to the fate of the Emperor
Napoleon, to accompany him, to follow him, and to
alleviate, as far as lies in my power, the unjust treatment
he experiences, through the most unheard-of violation of
the law of nations, of which I am the more particularly
sensible as it was I who conveyed to him the offer and
assurance of Captain Maitland of the Bellerophon, purporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>that he had orders to receive the Emperor and
his suite under the protection of the British flag, if
agreeable to him, and to convey him to England.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Emperor Napoleon’s letter to the Prince
Regent, which is known to all England, and which I
had previously communicated to Captain Maitland,
without his having made the slightest observation on it,
explains to the world much better than any thing I can
say how frankly the Emperor met this offer of hospitality,
and, consequently, how much he has been the dupe of
his sincerity and confidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Notwithstanding the experience I have had of the
horrors of a residence on the Island of St. Helena, which
is so prejudicial to the Emperor’s health, and to that of
every European, and though, during the six months
which we have passed on the island, I have been subjected
to every species of privation, which I myself daily
multiply, in order to avoid, as much as possible, the
violation of that respect which my rank and habits demand,
yet, constant to my first sentiments, and resolved
that for the future no fear of misfortune, or hope of
advantage, shall separate me from the Emperor Napoleon,
I repeat my desire to remain with him, and to submit to
whatever restrictions may be arbitrarily imposed on him."</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FAREWELL VISIT OF THE LATE GOVERNOR.—INTERESTING CONVERSATION.—REMARK OF AN OLD ENGLISH SOLDIER.</h3>

<p class='c007'>20th.—Colonel Wilks, being on the eve of his departure
for Europe, called with his daughter to take
leave of the Emperor. The young lady was presented
by Madame Bertrand. I have already mentioned that
Colonel Wilks had formerly been Governor of the
Colony, for the East India Company; he was succeeded
by the Admiral, in the King’s name, when, in consequence
of our removal to St. Helena, the island was
transferred from the possession of the Company to that
of the Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was in a remarkably cheerful humour.
He conversed for some time with the ladies,
and then took Colonel Wilks aside to the recess of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of the windows, whither I followed to serve as interpreter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Col. Wilks, as I have probably mentioned before, was
for a long time the diplomatic agent of the Company in
the Indian Peninsula; he has written a history of that
country. He is a man of extensive information, and
possesses great knowledge of chemistry. Thus he was
at once a soldier, an author, a diplomatist, and a chemist.
The Emperor put questions to him relative to all
these subjects, and treated them himself with great
fluency and spirit. The conversation was lively and
varied; and it was maintained for upwards of two hours.
The following are the principal particulars which I
noted down. I shall probably in some measure repeat
what I have said before, for the Emperor and Colonel
Wilks had, some months ago, a long conversation on
precisely the same topics; but that is of no importance;
these subjects are so interesting that I would rather
incur the risk of repeating than of losing any thing
connected with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor began by speaking of the English army,
its organization, and particularly its system of promotion.
He compared it with the French army, and
repeated what I have formerly stated with regard to the
excellent composition of our military force, the advantage
of the Conscription, and the bravery of our troops.
Then, turning to the subject of politics, he said, “You
lost America by liberation: you will lose India by invasion.
The first loss was perfectly natural; as children
advance in years, they break the parental bonds. But,
for the Hindoos, they are not advancing at all. They
still remain children. The catastrophe, therefore, can
only proceed from without. You are not aware of all
the dangers with which you were threatened by my arms
or my negotiations. As for my Continental system, you
perhaps laughed at it?” “Sire,” replied the Colonel,
“we affected to do so, but all men of judgment felt the
full force of it.”—"Well," continued the Emperor,
"I stood alone in my opinion on the Continent; and I
was forced for the moment to employ violence every
where. At length my plan began to be understood. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>tree already bears its fruit. I made the beginning;
time will do the rest.... Had I maintained
my power, I would have changed the course of trade,
and the direction of industry. I had naturalized sugar
and indigo in France, and I should have naturalized
cotton, and many other articles of foreign produce. I
should have knocked up the Colonies, if we had continued
to be denied a share of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“With us the impulse was most powerful. National
prosperity and science advanced beyond measure. Yet
your Ministers proclaimed through all Europe that the
French were overwhelmed with misery, and were retrograding
to a state of barbarism. Thus the view of our
internal prosperity strangely surprised the vulgar mass,
and even disconcerted the more thinking portion of the
European public. The strides of knowledge in France
were gigantic. The ideas of the French people were
every where properly directed and extended. We took
pains to render science popular. I was informed that
your countrymen were distinguished for their knowledge
of chemistry; and yet I will not decide on which side of
the water the most able chemist will be found.”—"In
France," said the Colonel immediately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is of little importance,” continued the Emperor;
“but I maintain that in the mass of the French people
there is ten, and perhaps a hundred, times more chemical
knowledge than in England; because the manufacturing
classes now employ that science in their daily labour.
This was one of the characteristics of my school. Had
I been allowed sufficient time, there would soon have
been no such thing as trades in France; they would all
have been converted into arts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor concluded with these remarkable observations:
"England and France held in their hands the
fate of the world; and particularly that of European
civilization. What injury have we not done to each
other!——What good might we not have done! Under
Pitt’s system, we desolated the world; and what has
been the result? You imposed on France a tax of fifteen
hundred millions of francs, and raised it by means of
Cossacks. I laid a tax of seven thousand millions on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>you, and made you raise it with your own hands, by
your Parliament. Even now, after the victory you have
obtained, who can tell whether you may not sooner or
later sink under the weight of such a burden?——With
Fox’s system, we should have understood each
other; we should have accomplished and preserved the
emancipation of nations, the dominion of principles.
Europe would have presented but a single fleet and a
single army. We might have ruled the world. We
might every where have established peace and prosperity,
either by dint of force or persuasion. Yes, I repeat it,
what mischief have we not done! What good might we
not have effected!"</p>

<p class='c001'>Never was Napoleon in a more talkative humour. He
laughed more than once at the endeavours I made to
keep up with the volubility with which he uttered his
observations. As for the Colonel, he took his leave,
amazed and confounded by what he had heard.</p>

<p class='c001'>When he was gone, the Emperor continued to converse
for a long time in the drawing-room. He afterwards
went into the garden, in spite of the bad weather,
and sent for us all to join him. He was desirous of
reading the declarations which we had made; they
became the subject of conversation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Four ships arrived here to-day from Europe. They
had on board the 66th regiment, and had left England
before the Phaëton, which brought the new Governor,
Sir Hudson Lowe.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor good-humouredly related
the remark made by an old soldier of the 53rd, who,
having seen him yesterday for the first time, went back
to his comrades and said,—"What lies they told me
about Napoleon’s age; he is not old at all; the fellow
is still young enough for at least sixty campaigns."
We thought this expression savoured very much of the
Frenchman, and we laid claim to it as having proceeded
from one of our grenadiers. We then related to him a
number of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bons-mots</em></span> made by our soldiers during his
absence and on his return, with which he was much entertained.
But what particularly excited his risibility
was the answer made by a grenadier at Lyons. A grand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>review was held there, just after the Emperor had landed
on his return from Elba. The Commanding Officer
remarked to his soldiers that they were well clothed and
well fed, that their pay might be seen upon their persons:—"Yes,
certainly," replied the grenadier to whom
he addressed himself.—"Well!" continued the officer,
with a confident air, “it was not so under Bonaparte.
Your pay was in arrear, he was in your debt?”—"And
what did that signify," said the grenadier smartly, “if
we chose to give him credit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>21st.—The Emperor sent for me to attend him in the
garden, about four o’clock, to act as interpreter. Captain
Hamilton, the Commander of the Havannah frigate, was
to sail next day for Europe, and, with his officers, had
come to take leave of the Emperor. Captain Hamilton
spoke French. When I joined the party in the garden,
the Emperor was expressing himself with warmth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They wish to know what I desire?” said he; “I
demand my liberty or death. Report these words to
your Prince Regent. I no longer ask to hear from my
son, since they have had the barbarity to leave my first
request unanswered.... I was not your prisoner.
Savages would have had more respect for my situation.
Your Ministers have basely violated in my person the
sacred rights of hospitality; they have for ever dishonoured
England!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Captain Hamilton having ventured to observe that
Napoleon was not the prisoner of England alone, but of
all the Allied Powers, the Emperor warmly resumed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“I did not deliver myself up to Russia, there I should
doubtless have been well received; I did not surrender
myself to Austria, there I should have been equally well
treated; but I delivered myself up, of my own free will
and choice, to England, because I had confidence in her
laws and her public morals. I have been cruelly deceived!
But Heaven will avenge my wrongs; and,
sooner or later you will meet the punishment of a deed
for which mankind already reproaches you!——Repeat
all this to the Prince Regent, sir.” He accompanied
these last words with a motion of his hand, and dismissed
the Captain.</p>

<p class='c001'>We walked about for a few minutes, and on the return
of the Grand Marshal, who had accompanied Captain
Hamilton a short distance, we thought that it would
be proper to leave him alone with the Emperor; but I
had scarcely entered my room when he sent for me. He
was alone, in his own apartment; he asked me whether
I had not had enough of retirement during the day. I
told him that a feeling of respect and discretion had
alone induced me to leave him. To this he answered
that there was no occasion for it, as nothing had passed
that he wished to make a secret of. “Besides,” added
he, “a certain degree of freedom and ease is not without
its charm.” These words, which fell carelessly from
Napoleon’s lips, may better serve to show his character
than hundreds of pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>We then perused an English publication, containing
the official documents found in his portfolio, which was
taken at Waterloo. The Emperor was astonished himself
at the number of orders which he had issued almost
at the same moment, and the countless details which he
had directed in every quarter of the empire. “This
publication,” said he, “can do me no harm, after all. It
will at least satisfy every one that its contents are not
the production of a sluggard. They will compare me
with the legitimate Sovereigns, and I shall not suffer by
the comparison.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor conversed on several unconnected
subjects. In speaking of his Ambassadors, he
said that he considered M. de Narbonne as the only one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>who had fully deserved that title, and had really fulfilled
the duties of his office. “And that,” said he, “by the
peculiar advantages, not only of his talents, but of his
old-fashioned morals, his manners, and his name. When
an Ambassador has merely to prescribe, any one may fill
the post; one person is just as good as another; perhaps
an aide-de-camp is the best man that can be <a id='corr89.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='chosen'>chosen.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_89.7'><ins class='correction' title='chosen'>chosen.</ins></a></span>
But when it is necessary to negotiate, the affair is widely
different. In that case it is indispensable to present to
the old aristocracy of the Courts of Europe, only the
elements of that aristocracy, which, in fact, constitutes a
sort of free-masonry. If an Otto or an Andreossi were
to enter the saloons of Vienna, there would be a stop to
the interchange of opinion; habitual manners would
cease. They would be regarded as intruders and profaners,
and the mysteries of diplomacy would be suspended.
But how different would it be with a Narbonne,
possessing the advantages of affinity, sympathy, and
identity! A lady of the old nobility would perhaps resign
her person to a plebeian, though she would not discover
to him the secrets of the aristocracy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was much attached to M. de Narbonne,
and regretted him deeply. He had made him his aide-de-camp,
he observed, only because Maria Louisa,
through the intrigues of the persons composing her suite,
had refused to let him be appointed her gentleman of
honour; a post for which he was perfectly adapted.
“Until the period of his embassy,” continued the Emperor,
“we had been duped by Austria. In less than a
fortnight, M. de Narbonne penetrated all the secrets of
the cabinet of Vienna, and M. de Metternich was deeply
mortified at the appointment. However, by a singular
fatality, perhaps, even the success of M. de Narbonne
thwarted my views. I found that his talent was no less
fatal than useful. Austria, supposing that her designs
were guessed, threw aside the mask, and took precipitate
steps. Had less penetration been shewn on our part,
she would have acted with greater reserve and deliberation.
She would have prolonged her natural indecision,
and in the interim other chances might have
risen up.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Some one present having alluded to the embassies of
Dresden and Berlin, and being apparently inclined to
attach blame to our diplomatic agents in those courts, at
the period of the return from Moscow, the Emperor replied
that, at that period, the fault was not to be attributed
to persons, but to things; that with a single glance
any one might have foreseen what would happen; and
that, for his part, he had not been deceived for a moment.
He added that if he had not in person conducted
the army back to Wilna, and into Germany, it was
through the fear of not being able himself to reach
France. He wished, he said, to obviate this imminent
danger by the boldness of his movements in crossing
Germany rapidly and alone. He was, however, on the
point of being taken in Silesia: “but luckily,” said he,
"the Prussians were deliberating at the moment when
they ought to have been acting. Their conduct in this
respect was like that which the Saxons observed towards
Charles XII., who said, when he quitted Dresden on a
similar occasion;—<a id='corr90.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“You'>‘You</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_90.20'><ins class='correction' title='“You'>‘You</ins></a></span> will see that they will hold a
consultation to-morrow upon the expediency of having
detained me <a id='corr90.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to-day.”'>to-day.’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_90.22'><ins class='correction' title='to-day.”'>to-day.’”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Before dinner the Emperor called me into his closet
to go over some English exercises with him. He told
me that he had just been calculating the expenses of his
toilet, and that it cost him about four napoleons per
month. We laughed at the immensity of the budget.
He talked of ordering some clothes, shoes, boots, &amp;c.
from the tradesmen in Europe who had his measures. I
thought that this would be attended with serious inconvenience,
and, after some consideration, we were convinced
that it would never be permitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is, however,” observed the Emperor, “extremely
vexatious to be thus deprived of money; and I wish to
come to some settlement on this point. As soon as the
bill, which is to determine our situation here, shall be
notified to me, I intend to make arrangements for receiving
an annual loan of seven or eight millions of napoleons
from Eugene. He cannot refuse me. He has
received from me perhaps upwards of forty-millions;
and it would be an insult to his sentiments to doubt his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>readiness to serve me. Besides, we have long accounts
to settle together. I am sure, if I had appointed a committee
of my Councillors of State to draw up a report on
this subject, they would have presented me with a balance
of at least ten or twelve millions against Eugene.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At dinner the Emperor asked us some questions respecting
the sum necessary to enable a bachelor to live in
a European capital, or for the support of a plain family
establishment, or the maintenance of a family in a style
of elegance. He is fond of these questions and calculations;
he treats them with great shrewdness, and enters
into the most curious details.</p>

<p class='c001'>We each presented our budgets, and agreed that a
residence in Paris would cost 15,000, 40,000, and
100,000 francs. The Emperor dwelt much on the
prices of various articles, and even on the prices of the
same articles, as they are charged to different persons,
and under different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When I was about to leave the army of Italy,” said
he, “to return to Paris, Madame Bonaparte wrote to
inform me that she had furnished, in the best possible
style, a small house that we had in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Rue de la Victoire</em></span>.
The house was not worth more than 40,000 francs.
What was my surprise and vexation to find that the
drawing-room furniture, which, after all, appeared to me
nothing out of the way, was charged at the enormous
rate of between 120 and 130,000 francs. In vain did I
remonstrate; I was obliged to pay the amount. The
upholsterer showed me the directions he had received,
and which required that every article should be the very
best in its kind. Every thing had been made after new
designs, and the designs themselves had been invented
expressly for the fitting up of my house. Any judge of
the case must have condemned me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then adverted to the extravagant charges
made for furnishing the imperial Palaces, and the vast
saving which he had made on this point. He told us
the price of the throne, the imperial ornaments, &amp;c.
Nothing could be more curious than to hear him detail
these charges, together with his own plans of economy.
How much I regret not having noted them down at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>time! The following particulars will serve to show some
of the methods which he adopted for ascertaining the
correctness of the accounts that were presented to
him:—</p>

<p class='c001'>On one occasion, when he returned to the Tuileries,
which had been magnificently fitted up during his absence,
those about him were anxious to direct his attention
to all the new furniture and decorations. After
expressing his satisfaction at every thing he saw, he
walked up to a window overhung with a rich curtain,
and, asking for a pair of scissars, cut off a superb gold
acorn which was suspended from the drapery, and coolly
putting it into his pocket, he continued his inspection to
the great astonishment of all present, who were unable
to guess his motive. Some days afterwards, at his levee,
he drew the acorn from his pocket and gave it to the
person who superintended the furnishing of the palace.
“Here,” said he, “Heaven forbid that I should think
you rob me; but some one has doubtless robbed you.
You have paid for this at the rate of one-third above its
value. They have dealt with you as though you had
been the steward of a great nobleman. You would have
made a better bargain if you had not been known.”
The fact was that Napoleon, having walked out one
morning in disguise (as he was often in the habit of
doing), called at some of the shops in the Rue Saint
Denis, where he enquired the price of ornaments similar
to that which he had cut from the curtain, and enquired
the value of various articles of furniture like those provided
for the palace, and thus, as he said, he arrived at
the result in its simplest form. Every one knew his
habits in this respect. These, he said, were his grand
plans for ensuring domestic economy, which, notwithstanding
his extreme magnificence, was carried to the
utmost degree of precision and regularity.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of his numerous occupations he himself revised
all his accounts; but he had his own method of doing
this, and they were always presented to him in their details.
He would cast his eye on the first article, sugar
for example, and, finding some thousands of pounds set
down, he would take a pen, and say to the person who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>drew up the accounts: “How many persons are there
in my household?”—"Sire, so many:" (and it was necessary
to give the answer immediately.)—"And how
many pounds of sugar do you suppose they consume per
day on an average?"—"Sire, so many."—He immediately
made his calculation, and, having satisfied himself,
he would give back the paper, saying, “Sir, I have
doubled your estimate of the daily consumption, and yet
you are enormously beyond the mark. Your account is
erroneous. Make it out again, and let me have greater
correctness.” This reproof would be sufficient to establish
the strictest regularity. Thus he sometimes said of
his private, as of his public, administration, “I have introduced
such order, and employed so many checks, that
I cannot be much imposed on. If I am wronged at all,
I leave the guilty person to settle the matter with his
own conscience. He will not sink under the weight of
his crime, for it cannot be very heavy.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE GOVERNOR’S VISIT TO MY APARTMENT.—CRITIQUE ON VOLTAIRE’S MAHOMET.—REMARKS ON THE MAHOMET OF HISTORY.—GRETRY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>22nd—25th. The weather has been very bad for
several days past. The Emperor discontinued his morning
walks, and applied himself with greater regularity to
his different occupations. He dictated every morning
on the events of 1814.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Hudson Lowe came to visit our establishment.
He entered my apartment and remained there for a quarter
of an hour. He expressed his regret for the inconveniences
to which we were exposed; and observed that
we were lodged in bivouacs rather than in apartments.
He was right; the pitched paper which had been used
for the rooms was already beginning to yield to the effect
of the hot climate; when the sun shone I was stifled;
and when it rained I was inundated. Sir Hudson Lowe
said that he would give directions for having these evils
remedied as far as possible, and politely added that he
had brought with him about 1500 or 2000 French volumes,
which, as soon as they were arranged, he should
feel great pleasure in placing at our service.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Racine and Voltaire occupied us for these two or three
evenings. Phedre and Athalie, which were read to us
by the Emperor, afforded us delightful entertainment;
for his observations and commentaries gave twofold interest
to what he read.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mahomet was the subject of deep criticism. “Voltaire,”
said the Emperor, "in the character and conduct
of his hero, has departed both from nature and history.
He has degraded Mahomet, by making him descend to
the lowest intrigues. He has represented a great man,
who changed the face of the world, acting like a scoundrel,
worthy of the gallows. He has no less absurdly
travestied the character of Omar, which he has drawn
like that of a cut-throat in a melo-drama.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Voltaire committed a fundamental error in attributing
to intrigue that which was solely the result of opinion.
Those who have wrought great changes in the
world never succeeded by gaining over chiefs, but always
by exciting the multitude. The first is the resource of
intrigue, and produces only secondary results: the second
is the resort of genius, and transforms the face of
the universe!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, adverting to the truth of history, expressed
his disbelief of all that was attributed to Mahomet.
“He must doubtless have been like all chiefs of sects,”
said he. “The Koran, having been written thirty
years after his death, may have recorded many falsehoods.
The Empire of the Prophet, his doctrine and his
mission, being established and fulfilled, people might and
must have spoken accordingly. Still it remains to be
explained how the mighty event which we are certain
did take place, namely, the conquest of the world, could
have been effected in the short space of fifty or sixty
years. By whom was it brought about? By the hordes
of the desert, who, as we are informed, were few in
number, ignorant, unwarlike, undisciplined, and destitute
of system. And yet they opposed the civilized
world, abounding in resources. Fanaticism could not
have accomplished this miracle, for fanaticism must have
had time to establish her dominion, and the career of
Mahomet lasted only thirteen years.”—The Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>conceived that, independently of the fortuitous events by
which prodigies are sometimes brought about, there must
have been in this case some hidden circumstance which
has not reached our knowledge. He was of opinion,
that Europe had doubtless sunk beneath the results of
some primary cause, of which we are ignorant;—that
the different races of people, who suddenly issued from
the deserts, had perhaps been engaged in long civil wars,
in which men of heroic character and great talent might
have risen up, and irresistible impulses have been
created.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all that relates to oriental affairs, Napoleon departed
materially from the common opinions which are
derived from the books usually regarded as authorities.
He said that on this subject he entertained ideas peculiar
to himself, though perhaps they were not very well defined;
and that his expedition to Egypt had brought
about this result in his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But to return to Voltaire,” said he, “it is astonishing
how ill his dramas are adapted for reading.—When
criticism and good taste are not cheated by pomp of
diction and scenic illusion, he immediately loses a thousand
per cent. It will scarcely be believed,” continued
he, “that, at the time of the Revolution, Voltaire had
superseded Corneille and Racine. The beauties of
these two great dramatists lay dormant, until the First
Consul again brought them into notice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor spoke truly. It is very certain that when
he brought us back to civilization, he at the same time
restored us to good taste. He revived our national dramatic
and lyric master-pieces—even those which had
been proscribed for political reasons. Thus Richard
C&oelig;ur-de-Lion was again brought upon the stage, though
a tender interest had as it were consecrated it to the
Bourbons.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor Gretry,” said the Emperor, “had long urged
me to permit the performance of the opera. It was
rather a dangerous experiment, and a violent uproar was
predicted. The representation however went off without
any unpleasant circumstances, and I ordered it to be repeated
for a week or a fortnight in succession, until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>public were completely tired of it. The charm being
broken, Richard continued to be played like any ordinary
piece, until the time when the Bourbons in their turn
prohibited it, because it excited an interest in my
favour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This strange vicissitude has, it is said, since been renewed
with regard to the drama of Prince Edward the
Pretender. The Emperor prohibited the piece on account
of the Bourbons, and the Bourbons have recently
proscribed it on account of the Emperor.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MY VISIT TO PLANTATION HOUSE.—SIR HUDSON LOWE’S INSINUATIONS.—HIS FIRST ILL-NATURED TRICK.—NAPOLEON’S PROCLAMATIONS.—HIS POLICY IN EGYPT.—HIS CONFESSION OF AN ILLEGAL ACT.</h3>

<p class='c007'>26th.—I went to pay my first visit to Plantation-House.
I thought Lady Lowe a pretty and amiable
woman, though there was something of the actress
about her. Sir Hudson Lowe married a short time before
his departure from Europe, for the express purpose, it is
said, of having his wife to assist him in doing the
honours of the colony. I understand that this lady was
the widow of an officer of the regiment which Sir
Hudson Lowe formerly commanded, and the sister of
a colonel killed at Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor showed me the most marked politeness
and attention. He remarked that we were old
acquaintances, though I was not aware of the fact.
He said he had been much gratified by the perusal
of M. Lesage’s Atlas, though he had never dreamed
that he should one day be introduced to the author.
He had first seen the work in Sicily, where he
got it smuggled from Naples; and he was inexhaustible
in his praises of it. He had frequently read the account
of the battle of Jena, with General Blucher, at the head-quarters
where he was English commissioner, during the
campaign of 1814. He said that he had always admired
the liberal expressions and the spirit of moderation and
impartiality which were observed towards England; but
that at the period when he first examined the work, he
had been forcibly struck by some equivocal passages
which seemed to breathe hostility to, or censure of, him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>who then governed us. He added that he had accounted
for these passages at the time, by my character
and doctrines as an emigrant; but that now he
thought it a singular contradiction, to find me here
in the suite of that person.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now we had just been informed that Sir Hudson
Lowe was, when in Italy, a kind of Head Police
Officer, and an active agent of the system of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>espionage</em></span>.
I could not help suspecting that a certain insinuation
was intended to be conveyed in these remarks. If
this were really the fact (and the Emperor entertained
no doubt of it), then, at least, the business was cleverly
managed on his part; and had I felt less self-respect
than I did I could have given a smart retort,
and the matter might have been carried to some
length. I, however, merely replied that he had totally
misunderstood the application of the equivocal passages
in question, and that they could not have any
reference to Napoleon, since I was now attached to his
person.</p>

<p class='c001'>On my return home, I found two French works
which Sir H. Lowe had sent to me in the morning,
accompanied by a note, in which he expressed a hope
that their perusal would gratify the Emperor. Will it
be credited? One of these works was the Abbé de
Pradt’s Embassy to Warsaw. This I may note down
as Sir Hudson Lowe’s <em>first ill-natured trick</em>. The work
was a novelty, it is true; but it was a libel solely
directed against Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the other book, when I first saw it, I thought
I had found a treasure. I imagined it would indemnify
us for the want of the Moniteur, and furnish us with
the materials which we stood so much in need of. Its
title described it to be a collection of all the proclamations
and official documents of Napoleon, as General,
First Consul, and Emperor. But it was published by
Goldsmith the libeller, and was very incomplete, the
most striking bulletins being suppressed, the addresses
to the Legislative Body mutilated, &amp;c. But, even in
this imperfect state, the collection still remains the
noblest monument that any man ever left behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>After dinner the Emperor amused himself by reading,
in Goldsmith’s publications, some of his own proclamations
to the army of Italy. They produced a powerful
impression on himself; they interested and excited him.
“And yet,” said he, “they had the impudence to say
that I could not write!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He then turned to his proclamation to the army of
Egypt, and joked much about that in which he represented
himself as inspired and sent by God. “This was
quackery,” said he; “but it was quackery of the
highest order. Besides, the proclamation was composed
only for the purpose of being translated into high-flown
Arabic verse by one of the cleverest of the Sheiks. My
French troops,” continued he, “merely laughed at it; and
such was their disposition in this respect that, in order
to induce them to listen to the bare mention of religion,
I was myself obliged to speak very lightly on the subject,
to place Jews beside Christians, and Rabbis beside
Bishops, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The assertion made by Goldsmith of Napoleon’s
having assumed the Mussulman dress, is totally false.
If ever he entered a mosque, he said, it was always as a
conqueror, and not as a worshipper. He was of too
serious a turn, and had too much self-respect, to act in
an equivocal way on this point.</p>

<p class='c001'>“After all,” continued he, gaily, “it would not have
been so very extraordinary, even though circumstances
had induced me to embrace Islamism; and, as a good
Queen of France once said, ‘<em>You will talk to me so much
about it!</em>’... But I must have had good reasons
for my conversion. I must have had possession of all
as far as the Euphrates, at least. Change of religion for
private interest is inexcusable; but it may be pardoned
in consideration of immense political results. Henry IV.
said, ‘<em>Paris is well worth a mass</em>.’ Will it then be said
that the dominion of the East, and perhaps the subjugation
of all Asia, were not worth a turban and a pair of
trousers? And, in truth, the whole matter was reduced
to this; for the grand Sheiks had studied how to render
it easy to us. They had smoothed down the greatest
obstacles; allowed us the use of wine, and dispensed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>with all corporeal formalities. We should therefore have
lost only our small-clothes and hats. I say we; for the
army, in the disposition in which it then was, would
have entertained but few scruples on the subject, and
would have made it a mere matter of jest and laughter.
But what would have been the consequence? I should
have turned my back on Europe, and the old civilization
of the continent would have been bound up. And who
would then have troubled themselves about the course of
Fate in France, or the regeneration of the age!...
Who would have attempted it! Who could have succeeded!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Continuing his examination of Goldsmith’s book, the
Emperor by chance cast his eyes on the Act of the Consuls,
by which General Latour Foissac was cashiered for
the surrender of Mantua. “This,” said the Emperor,
“was, without doubt, an illegal and tyrannical act, but
it was a necessary evil; it was the fault of the laws.
The general was a hundred and a thousand times guilty,
and yet it was doubtful whether we ought to have condemned
him. His acquittal would have produced the
most fatal effect. We therefore struck the blow with the
combined arms of honour and opinion. But I say again,
it was a tyrannical act, one of those severe strokes which
are sometimes indispensably necessary in a great nation,
and under important circumstances.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE FIRST INSULT, AND THE FIRST INSTANCE OF CRUELTY, ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR.—CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>27th.—About two o’clock, the Governor came to
Longwood, and asked the Emperor’s leave to summon
all the domestics before him. This was the first insult
received from the Governor.</p>

<p class='c001'>He probably wished to ascertain whether their declarations
had been spontaneously made. M. de Montholon,
who had the superintendence of the servants, informed
Sir Hudson Lowe, in the Emperor’s name, that his
Majesty had not imagined there could have been any
pretence for interference between him and his valet de
chambre; that, if his permission were asked, he decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>refused it; that, if the Governor’s instructions
required the adoption of this measure, the power was
in his own hands, and he might use it: this would only
be adding another outrage to those which the English
Ministers had already accumulated upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this moment I joined M. de Montholon and the
Governor. I could easily perceive that the two interlocutors
were by no means pleased with each other. After
a few moments’ silence and evident dissatisfaction,
the Governor turned to me, and remarked that pains
seemed to be taken to create difficulties and embarrassments
in all that regarded the Emperor. I observed
that Napoleon’s household having been appointed for
him, and not being one of his choice, it was perfectly
natural that he should object to any interference with
his servants; that, if the Governor had any doubts to
clear up relative to the domestics, two courses were open
to him. He might resort to indirect and underhand
means, which at least would not wound our feelings; or
he might employ force and authority; that he possessed
these, and there was nothing to restrain him from resorting
to them. But I added that the method he was
pursuing was quite hostile to our habits. I assured him
that the Emperor was desirous of being as accommodating
as possible, in the new situation in which he was
placed: that he wished to retire within himself, asking
for nothing but to be left unannoyed: that fortune had
indeed robbed him of his power, but that nothing could
deprive him of his self-respect: and, finally, that the
consciousness and the delicacy of his dignity were the
only things that remained to him of which he could call
himself the master.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile the servants were assembled, and M. de
Montholon and I withdrew, that we might not sanction
such a measure by our presence. The Governor spoke
to the domestics, and afterwards joined us, saying:—"I
am now satisfied. I can inform the English Government
that they all signed it freely and voluntarily."</p>

<p class='c001'>But his ill-humour was not yet fully spent; for he
began most inopportunely to extol the beautiful situation
of Longwood, observing that, after all, we were not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>very badly off. And when we remarked that we felt
most severely the want of shade in this burning climate,
and that there was scarcely a single tree on the Island.
“Oh! we will plant some!” said he. Could any thing
have been more cutting?... This may be recorded as
the first trait of brutality on the part of the Governor.
After this he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c001'>About five o’clock the Emperor got into the carriage
to take an airing. As we were going out, he said,
“Gentlemen, but for one man I should have been master
of the world! And who do you think this one man
was?” We were all eagerness to know.... “The
<a id='corr101.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Abbe'>Abbé</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_101.13'><ins class='correction' title='Abbe'>Abbé</ins></a></span> de Pradt,” continued the Emperor, “the Almoner
of the God of War.” On hearing this we could not
repress our laughter. “I am serious,” continued he,
“the Abbé thus expresses himself in his Embassy to
Warsaw; you may read it yourselves. The work is
altogether a wicked attack on me, an absolute libel,
overwhelming me with insults and calumnies. Whether
I happened to be in a particularly good-humour at the
time, or whether it was because only truth offends, I
know not; but, at all events, I laughed heartily when I
read the work, and it afforded me abundant entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Misunderstandings occasionally occurred between two
individuals of the Emperor’s suite. This circumstance
would not have been mentioned here, but that it serves
to introduce some characteristic traits of the mind and
heart of him to whom we are devoted. The newspapers
of the time, and the return of one of the parties to
Europe, in consequence of these misunderstandings,
however, have already given publicity to the affair.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I entered the drawing-room, to wait until the
announcement of dinner, I found the Emperor speaking
with the utmost warmth on this subject, which vexed
him exceedingly. His language was energetic and
moving.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You followed me,” said he, “with the view of cheering
my captivity! Be brothers, then! otherwise you but
annoy me. If you wish to render me happy, be brothers,
or you are but a torment to me! You talk of fighting,
and that before my face. I am no longer then the object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of your attention. You forget that the observation of
foreigners is fixed on you.... I wish you all to be
animated by my spirit.... I wish that every one
around me should be happy, and share the few enjoyments
that yet remain to us. Even down to little
Emmanuel there, I would wish you all to have your due
share....”</p>

<p class='c001'>The announcement of dinner put an end to the reprimand.
The Emperor was silent during the repast; at
the dessert he ordered Voltaire to be brought to him,
and began to read some of his dramas; but he soon
laid aside the books. We daily became more and more
tired of Voltaire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor retired very early, and soon after desired
me to attend him in his bed-chamber, where I remained
with him until a late hour.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE ABBÉ DE PRADT, AND HIS EMBASSY TO WARSAW.<br /> THE RUSSIAN WAR.—ITS ORIGIN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>28th.—The Emperor again recurred to the Abbé de
Pradt and his work, which he reduced to merely the
first and last pages. “In the first,” said he, "he
states himself to be the only man who arrested Napoleon’s
career; in the last, he shows that the Emperor,
in his way back from Moscow, dismissed him from the
embassy, which is true; and this fact his self-love
would fain misrepresent or revenge. This is the whole
work....</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the Abbé,” continued the Emperor, “did not fulfil
at Warsaw any of the objects which had been intended;
on the contrary, he did a great deal of mischief. Reports
against him poured in upon me from every quarter.
Even the young men, the clerks attached to the embassy,
were surprised at his conduct, and went so far as to accuse
him of maintaining an understanding with the
enemy; which, however, I by no means believed. But
he certainly had a long conversation with me, which he
misrepresents, as might be expected; and it was at the
very moment when he was delivering a long prosing
speech, which appeared to me a mere string of absurdity
and impertinence, that I scrawled on the corner of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>chimney-piece the order to withdraw him from his embassy,
and to send him as soon as possible to France; a
circumstance which was the cause of a good deal of
merriment at the time, and which the Abbé seems very
desirous of concealing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I cannot refrain from transcribing from the Embassy
to Warsaw, M. de Pradt’s account of the Emperor Napoleon’s
court at Dresden. His remarks on this subject
are striking, and afford a faithful picture both of men
and things at that period.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You,” he says, "who wish to form a just idea of
the omnipotence exercised in Europe by the Emperor
Napoleon, who wish to fathom the depths of terror into
which almost every European sovereign has fallen, transport
yourselves in imagination to Dresden, and there
contemplate that superb Prince, at the period of his
highest glory, so nearly bordering on his fall!</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Emperor occupied the state apartments of the
palace whither he had transferred a considerable portion
of his household. Here he gave grand dinner parties;
and, with the exception of the first Sunday, when the
King of Saxony had a gala, Napoleon’s parties were always
attended by the Sovereigns and different members
of their families, according to the invitations issued by
the Grand Marshal of the Palace. Some private individuals
were admitted on these occasions. I enjoyed that
honour on the day of my appointment to the embassy of
Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Emperor’s levees were held here, as at the Tuileries,
at nine o’clock. Then with what timid submission
did a crowd of Princes, mingling with the courtiers, and
often scarcely perceived among them, anxiously await
the moment for presenting themselves before the new
arbiter of their destinies!"</p>

<p class='c001'>These passages, and some others of equal truth and
beauty of diction, are lost amidst a heap of details full of
misrepresentation and malice. “They are distorted facts
and mutilated conversations,” said the Emperor: and,
adverting to the accounts of the Empress of Austria,
which were filled with adulation, and of the Emperor
Alexander, whose amiable virtues and brilliant qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>are extolled by the author, to the detriment of Napoleon.
“Surely,” exclaimed the Emperor, “this is not a French
bishop, but one of the eastern magi—a worshipper of the
rising sun.” I shall both now and henceforward suppress,
from a feeling of justice, several other articles and
many details. The following observations may however
be noted down, in opposition to the Abbé de Pradt’s endeavours
to prove that the French were the unjust
aggressors in the contest with Russia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, speaking of the Russian war, said: "No
events are trifling with regard to nations and sovereigns;
for it is such that govern their destinies. For some time
a misunderstanding had sprung up between France and
Russia. France reproached Russia with the violation of
the continental system, and Russia required an indemnification
for the Duke of Oldenburg, and raised other pretensions.
Russian troops were approaching the duchy
of Warsaw, and a French army was forming in the north
of Germany. Yet we were far from being determined
on war, when, all on a sudden, a new Russian army
commenced its march towards the Duchy; and, as an
ultimatum, an insolent note was presented at Paris by
the Russian Ambassador, who, in the event of its nonacceptance,
threatened to quit Paris in eight days. I
considered this as a declaration of war. It was long
since I had been accustomed to this sort of tone. I was
not in the habit of allowing myself to be anticipated. I
could march to Russia at the head of the rest of Europe;
the enterprise was popular; the cause was one which
interested Europe. It was the last effort that remained
to France. Her fate, and that of the new European
system, depended on the struggle. Russia was the last
resource of England. The peace of the whole world
rested with Russia. The event could not be doubtful. I
commenced my march; but when I reached the frontier
I, to whom Russia had declared war by withdrawing her
Ambassador, still considered it my duty to send mine
(Lauriston) to the Emperor Alexander at Wilna: he was
rejected, and the war commenced!</p>

<p class='c001'>"Yet, who would credit it? Alexander and myself
were in the situation of two bullies, who, without wishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to fight, were endeavouring to terrify each other.
I would most willingly have maintained peace; I was
surrounded and overwhelmed with unfavourable circumstances,
and all that I have since learned convinces me
that Alexander was still less eager for war than myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>"M. de Romanzoff, who had maintained communications
at Paris, and who some time afterwards, when the
Russians experienced reverses, was very severely treated
by Alexander for the course he had induced him to pursue,
had assured the Russian Emperor, that the moment
was come when Napoleon, in his embarrassments, would
readily make some sacrifices to avoid war; that the favourable
opportunity should not be allowed to escape;
that it was only necessary to assume a bold attitude, and
a tone of firmness; that indemnity would be obtained
for the Duke of Oldenburg; that Dantzick might be
gained, and that Russia would thus acquire immense
weight in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Such was the cause of the movement of the Russian
troops, and of the insolent note of Prince Kourakin, who,
doubtless, was not in the secret, and who had been
foolish enough to execute his instructions in too literal
a way. The same mistaken notions, and the same system
also, occasioned the refusal to receive Lauriston at Wilna.
This was an instance of the errors and misfortunes which
attended my new diplomacy. It stood insulated, without
affinity or contact, in the midst of the objects which it
had to direct. Had my Minister for Foreign affairs been
a member of the old aristocracy, and a man of superior
ability, no doubt he would have observed the cloud that
was gathering, and might have prevented our going to
war.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr105.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Talleyrand,'>“Talleyrand,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_105.33'><ins class='correction' title='Talleyrand,'>“Talleyrand,</ins></a></span> perhaps, might have done this: but it
was above the powers of the new school. I could not
make the discovery myself; my dignity precluded personal
explanations. I could form my judgment only
from documents, and in vain did I turn them over and
over, for I was sure at last to arrive at a point where
they could make no reply to my enquiries.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Scarcely had I opened the campaign, when the
mask fell, and the real sentiments of the enemy were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>developed. In the course of two or three days Alexander,
alarmed at our first successes, despatched a messenger
to me, to say that if I would evacuate the invaded territory,
and fall back as far as the Niemen, he would
enter upon negotiations. But I in my turn took this for
a stratagem. I was elated with success; I had taken
the Russian army in the very fact, in the critical moment;
I had cut off Bagration, and I had reason to
hope that I should destroy him. I thought, however,
that the enemy merely wanted to gain time for the purpose
of rallying his forces. Had I been convinced of
Alexander’s sincerity, I should doubtless have acceded
to his proposition of falling back to the Niemen. In
that case, he would not have passed the Dwina; Wilna
would have been neutralized: and there Alexander and
myself, accompanied by a few battalions of our guards,
would have negotiated in person. How many <a id='corr106.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='arragements'>arrangements</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_106.16'><ins class='correction' title='arragements'>arrangements</ins></a></span>
should I not have proposed!... Alexander
would have had only to take his choice, and we should
have separated good friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Yet, in spite of the events which succeeded, and
which left my enemy triumphant, is it quite certain that
the measures I have just hinted at would have been less
advantageous than those which have since been pursued?
Alexander marched to Paris, it is true, but he came accompanied
by the forces of all Europe. He has gained
Poland: but what will be the result of the shock given
to the whole European system; of the agitation into
which every nation has been thrown; of the increase of
European influence over the rest of Russia through the
accumulation of new acquisitions: the expeditions in
which the Russian troops are engaged in remote quarters;
and the influence of the incongruous mass of men
and knowledge which have taken refuge in Russia from
foreign parts?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will the Russian sovereigns be content to consolidate
what they have acquired? If, on the contrary, they
should be influenced by ambition, what extravagant
enterprises may they not attempt! And yet they have
lost Moscow, her wealth and resources, and those of
many other cities! These are wounds which will bleed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>for half a century. But at Wilna we might have entered
into arrangements for the advantage of all, subjects as
well as sovereigns!”</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion, the Emperor said, "I might
have shared with Russia the possession of the Turkish
empire. We had oftener than once contemplated the
idea, but Constantinople was always the obstacle that
opposed its execution. The Turkish capital was the
grand stumbling-block between us. Russia wanted it,
and I could not resign it. Constantinople is worth an
empire of itself. It is the real keystone of power; for
he who possesses it may rule the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What then?” said the Emperor, resuming the
former question, “what has Alexander gained, which he
might not have secured to better advantage at Wilna?”—Some
one present replied, “Sire, he has conquered,
and he remains triumphant.”—"That may be the vulgar
opinion," exclaimed the Emperor, "but no Sovereign
should entertain such an idea. A monarch, if he himself
governs, or his councillors, if they govern for him,
must, in vast enterprises of this nature, attach less importance
to the victory than to its results. And even
though the case be limited to vulgar considerations, still
I maintain that the wished-for object has not been attained.
Even here the palm must be awarded to the
vanquished party. Who will pretend that my victories in
Germany were equalled by the successes of the Allies
in France? Will any thinking man, will any historian
pronounce such an opinion?</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Allies advanced with all Europe in their train,
against a force which might be almost counted as
nothing. They had 600,000 men in the line, and nearly
an equal number in reserve. If they had been beaten,
they had nothing to fear, they could have fallen back.
I, on the contrary, in Germany, 500 leagues from home,
had hardly a force equal to my enemy’s. I was surrounded
by sovereigns and people repressed only by fear,
and who, on the first disaster, were ready to rise against
me. But I triumphed amidst dangers constantly increasing;
I was incessantly compelled to exercise an
equal degree of address and energy. In all these enterprises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>I found it necessary to display a strange character,
strange views and a strange confidence in my own
plans, which were disapproved perhaps by every one
around me.</p>

<p class='c001'>"What deeds on the part of the Allies can be compared
with these? If I had not conquered at Austerlitz,
I should have had all Prussia on me. If I had not
proved victorious at Jena, Austria and Spain would have
assailed me in my rear. If I had not triumphed at
Wagram, which by the by, was a less decisive victory,
I had to fear that Russia would abandon me, that
Prussia would rise against me; and meanwhile the
English were already before Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Yet what was my conduct after the victory? At
Austerlitz, I gave Alexander his liberty, though I might
have made him my prisoner.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a> After Jena I left the
House of Prussia in possession of a throne which I had
conquered: after Wagram, I neglected to parcel out the
Austrian monarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr108.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='If'>“If</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_108.20'><ins class='correction' title='If'>“If</ins></a></span> all this be attributed merely to magnanimity, cold
and calculating politicians will doubtless blame me. But,
without rejecting that sentiment, to which I am not a
stranger, I had higher aims in view. I wished to bring
about the amalgamation of the great European interests,
in the same manner as I had effected the union of
parties in France. My ambition was one day to become
the arbiter in the great cause of nations and kings; it
was therefore necessary that I should secure to myself
claims on their gratitude, and seek to render myself
popular among them. This I could not do without losing
something in the estimation of the people. I was aware
of this. But I was powerful and fearless. I concerned
myself but little about transient popular murmurs, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>very sure that the result would infallibly bring the
people over to my side.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I committed a great fault after the battle of Wagram,
in not reducing the power of Austria still more.
She remained too strong for our safety, and to her we
must attribute our ruin. The day after the battle, I
should have made known, by proclamation, that I would
treat with Austria only on condition of the preliminary
separation of the three crowns of Austria, Hungary, and
Bohemia. Will it be credited? A Prince of the House
of Austria several times hinted to me the idea of transferring
one of the two last-mentioned crowns to himself,
or even raising him to the throne occupied by his own
family, on pretence that it was only thus that Austria
could be induced to act sincerely with me. He even
proposed to give me, by way of hostage, ——— and
moreover, every possible guarantee.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said, that he had even turned this idea
over in his own mind. He had hesitated about it for some
time previously to his marriage with Maria Louisa; but
after that event, continued he, it became impracticable.
He observed that on the subject of marriage his notions
were too citizen-like:—"Austria," said he, “had become
a portion of my own family; and yet my marriage
ruined me. If I had not thought myself safe and protected
by this alliance, I should have delayed for three
years the resurrection of Poland; I should have waited
until Spain was subdued and tranquil. I stepped upon
an abyss, covered by flowers.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE EMPEROR INDISPOSED.—HIS FIRST DAY OF COMPLETE SECLUSION.—THE PERSIAN AND TURKISH AMBASSADORS.—ANECDOTES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>29th.—About five o’clock the Grand Marshal visited
me in my chamber. He had not been permitted to see
the Emperor, who through indisposition had been confined
to his own apartment all day, and refused to see
any one. Towards evening I went out to take a stroll in
those paths in which the Emperor usually walked about
this time. I felt dull, being alone. We had dined without
the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>About nine o’clock, just as I was regretting that the
day had passed over without my seeing him, he sent for
me. I expressed my concern for his indisposition. He
replied that he was perfectly well, but that he had taken
a fancy to remain alone; that he had been reading all
day, and that the time had passed away swiftly and
agreeably.</p>

<p class='c001'>He however appeared low-spirited and languid. He
took my Atlas, which happened to be lying beside him,
and, opening it at the map of the world, he cast his eye
on Persia. “I had some excellent plans, with regard to
that country,” said he. “What a capital point of support
would it have been for my lever, whether I wished
to disturb Russia, or to invade India. I had set on foot
relations with Persia, and I hoped to bring them to the
point of intimacy, as well as those with Turkey. It
might have been supposed that the animals would have
understood their own interests sufficiently well to have
acceded to my propositions; but both Persians and Turks
evaded me at the decisive moment. English gold proved
more powerful than my plans. Some treacherous ministers,
for a few guineas, sacrificed the prosperity of
their country: which is usually the case under seraglio
monarchs or imbecile kings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then, abandoning politics, began to relate
some anecdotes of the seraglio, and adverted to the
Persians of Montesquiou, and his letters, which he said
were distinguished for wit, delicate observations, and
above all, for bitter satire on the time. He afterwards
spoke of the Turkish and Persian Ambassadors who were
in Paris during his reign. He asked me what impression
they produced in the French capital; whether they
paid visits, and received company, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>I replied that, during their stay in Paris, they engrossed
public attention, and formed a kind of raree-show
at Court. The Persian in particular attracted
curiosity. On his arrival, he willingly received visitors,
and as he made presents of perfumes and even shawls,
he was a great favourite with the ladies. But the great
number of those who paid their court to him soon forced
him to set bounds to his liberality, and, thenceforward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the rage being over, he was no longer thought of. I
added, that at Court, when the Emperor was not present,
we sometimes ventured, very inconsiderately to be sure,
to play off tricks at the expense of the oriental Ambassadors.
At a concert given one day by the Empress
Josephine, Asker-Kan, with his long painted beard, was
one of the company. He seemed to be heartily tired of
the music, and fell asleep standing with his back against
a wall, his feet thrust forward and resting against an arm
chair which stood in the corner by the fire-place. Some
one, by way of joke, drew the chair away softly, so that
his Excellency had well nigh fallen down at full length on
the floor, and being thus roused from his slumber, he
roared out lustily. Asker-Kan could more readily enter
into a joke than the Turkish Ambassador; but, on this
occasion he was in a great passion, and as we could only
understand each other by gestures, the scene was most
ludicrous. In the evening, the Empress enquired the cause
of the noise which she had heard during the concert;
and when the circumstance was explained to her, she
laughed a good deal and scolded us still more. “It was
very wrong, certainly,” observed the Emperor; “but
what business had he at the concert?”—"Sire," I replied,
“both he and the Turkish Ambassador went thither
with the view of paying court to you. They hoped that
your Majesty would be apprized of the circumstance,
though you were at that time five hundred leagues off.” I
added that on other occasions they had both proved themselves
accomplished courtiers, and that their wish to ingratiate
themselves with the Emperor carried them to
the most extravagant lengths. “We have often seen
them,” said I, “at the close of the grand diplomatic audiences
on Sunday, follow your Majesty to mass, and occupy
the pews in the chapel along with Cardinals of the
Holy Catholic Church.”—"What a monstrous spectacle!"
exclaimed the Emperor. “What a subversion
of their principles and habits!—What extraordinary
things I brought about; and yet all this was neither
ordered nor perceived.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation continuing on the two orientals, I
mentioned that I had been informed the Arch-chancellor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Cambacérès once gave them a grand dinner. Though
both from the same quarter, and members of the same
religion, yet they nevertheless evinced shades of character
totally different. The Turk, who was a disciple of
Omar, was the Jansenist, and the Persian, who was a
sectary of Ali, was the Jesuit. It was said that, at
Cambacérès’ dinner, they scrupulously watched each other
with regard to the wine, just as two Catholic Bishops
seated at the same table might be expected to keep a
vigilant look out, lest either should be tempted to eat
meat on a Friday.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Turk was gloomy and ignorant, and was looked
upon as little better than a brute; but the Persian possessed
literary information, was very talkative, and had
the reputation of being a clever man. It was observed
that he made no use of a knife and fork, either in eating
or helping himself to any dish at table; and he probably
would not have hesitated to help his neighbours in the
same unceremonious way. One of our customs particularly
attracted his notice; this was our practice of eating bread
with every dish. He said he could not conceive why we
were obliged always to eat the same article with every
thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>I believe I have already remarked that nothing amuses
the Emperor so much as accounts of the fashionable
world in Paris, anecdotes of our drawing-rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emigrants and the Faubourg St. Germain were
subjects on which he was always fond of conversing with
me when we were alone, and he accounted for this by
saying to me once, “I was well acquainted with every
thing that had relation to myself, but I never knew any
thing of those affairs.” He observed, that he had nevertheless
a natural desire to learn every thing that was
passing near him, and to hear the chit-chat of little
towns, &amp;c. “I heard a great deal on these subjects,”
added he, “during the period of my power; but whenever
any thing favourable was said, I put myself on my
guard—I was fearful of insinuations; and if, on the
contrary, any thing unfavourable was reported to me, I
mistrusted the accusation, and had enough to do to guard
against a feeling of contempt. Here, my dear Las
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Cases, none of these disadvantages exist; you and I already
belong to the other world; we are conversing in
the Elysian fields: you are without interested views, and
I am without suspicion.” I therefore eagerly seized every
opportunity that offered itself to entertain the Emperor
in this way. He perceived this, and gave me credit for
my intentions; for, at the conclusion of one of my
stories, he pinched my ear, and said, in a tone of voice
which delighted me: “I read a story in your Atlas of a
Northern Monarch who was immured in a prison, and
one of his soldiers solicited and obtained permission to
be imprisoned with him, in order that he might cheer his
spirits, either by inducing him to converse, or by relating
amusing stories to him. My dear Las Cases, you are
that soldier.”...</p>

<p class='c001'>On the present occasion I described to the Emperor the
hoax which had been played upon M. de Marbois, and
which he had not heard of before. It was as follows: one
day, as the story goes, Asker-Kan, who was indisposed, and
tired of his Persian treatment, gave orders to send for
M. Bourdois, one of the first physicians in Paris. The
messenger made a mistake, and went to M. de Marbois,
Ex-minister of the Treasury, and at that time President
of the Court of Accounts.—"His Excellency the Persian
Ambassador," said he, “is very ill, and wishes to see
you.” M. de Marbois could not conceive what business
the Persian Ambassador could possibly have with him:
but Asker-Kan was the envoy of a great Prince, and
there is nothing which vanity will not contrive to reconcile.
He proceeded with great pomp to the Ambassador’s
residence; and it must be allowed that there was
nothing in his dress, physiognomy, or deportment, at all
likely to undeceive the Persian, who, as soon as he saw
him, thrust out his tongue, and stretching forth his arm,
motioned him to feel his pulse. These extraordinary
gestures astonished M. de Marbois, but he thought they
might be some oriental fashion. He took the hand
which was offered, and pressed it cordially, when four
attendants entered with solemnity, and presented to the
Ex-minister a vessel of a very unequivocal nature, for his
better information on the state of the patient. At this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>spectacle, the grave M. de Marbois flew into a violent
passion, and asked what was the meaning of this extraordinary
behaviour. The mistake was explained; it
was M. Bourdois who had been wanted, and the similarity
in the sound of the two names had alone occasioned
the error. Poor M. de Marbois was the laughing-stock
of Paris, and for a long time he could not show his face
any where without exciting merriment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The drawing-rooms of Paris are indeed tremendous
with their jokes!” said the Emperor, “for it cannot be
denied that they are for the most part pointed and witty.
They always assail the enemy at the breach, and a total
defeat is the usual consequence.”—"It is true," said I,
“nothing was spared. Even religion was not held sacred,
and your Majesty may well suppose that neither you
nor the Empress escaped.”—"I dare say not," replied
the Emperor, “but no matter; what was said of us?”—“It
was reported. Sire, that one day your Majesty,
being much dissatisfied at the perusal of a despatch from
Vienna, said to the Empress, in a moment of ill-humour,
Your father is a blockhead (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>votre père est une ganache</em></span>).
Maria Louisa, who was unacquainted with many French
phrases, turned to the person nearest her, and, observing
that the Emperor had called her Father a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ganache</em></span>,
asked what the term meant. The courtier, embarrassed
at this unexpected interrogatory, stammered out
that the word signified a clever man, a man of judgment,
and extraordinary talent. Some time afterwards, the
Empress, with her newly learnt term fresh in her memory,
was present at the Council of State, and the discussion,
becoming somewhat warm, in order to put a stop
to it, she called on M. Cambacérès, who was yawning by
her side....—‘You must set us right on this important
point,’ said she, ‘you shall be our oracle; for I consider
you as the greatest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ganache</em></span> in the Empire.’” At
these words the Emperor held his sides with laughter.
“What a pity,” said he, “that this anecdote is not true!
Only imagine the scene. The offended dignity of Cambacérès,
the merriment of the whole council, and the
embarrassment of poor Maria Louisa, alarmed at the
success of her unconscious joke.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The conversation continued for a long time in this
way, and I spent about two hours with the Emperor; I
had exerted myself to talk as much as I possibly could
to divert him, and I had succeeded. The Emperor felt
his spirits revived, he even enjoyed a hearty laugh.
When he dismissed me, he felt much better, and I was
happy at the change.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SECOND DAY OF SECLUSION.—THE EMPEROR RECEIVES THE GOVERNOR IN HIS CHAMBER.—CHARACTERISTIC CONVERSATION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>30th.—To-day I and my son were engaged to dine at
Mr. Balcombe’s at the Briars. About half past three,
I went to receive the Emperor’s commands: he was the
same as yesterday, and did not intend to go out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Just before I had reached Hut’s Gate, the residence
of Madame Bertrand, I met the Governor on his way
to Longwood. He asked me how the Emperor was.
I told him that I felt uneasy about him, and that he had
not seen any of us yesterday. I added that though he
had told me this morning he was well, yet from his
countenance I should have expected a different account.</p>

<p class='c001'>About half past nine, we set out from the Briars on
our return to Longwood; it was very dark. A heavy
rain had come on, which was as sharp and cutting as
hail. We had a most disagreeable, troublesome, and
dangerous ride, being every moment on the point of
being precipitated into some abyss or other, for we were
obliged to gallop on at random without seeing where we
were going. We arrived at Longwood drenched to the
skin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor had given orders that I should attend
him on my return. He was well, but he had stayed at
home as he had done yesterday. He said he had been
waiting for me, and had many things to tell me.</p>

<p class='c001'>On learning that the Governor had arrived, he admitted
him into his chamber, though he was not dressed,
and was unable to rise from his couch. He said he had
discussed with him, in perfect composure, all the points
which naturally presented themselves to his mind. He
spoke of protesting against the treaty of the second of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>August, in which the Allied Sovereigns declared him an
exile and a prisoner. He asked what right these Sovereigns
had to dispose of him, without his consent, him
who was their equal, and had sometimes been their master.
He said, if he had thought proper to withdraw to
Russia, Alexander, who styled himself his friend, and
who never had any but political disputes with him,
would if he had not upheld him as a king, at least have
treated him as one. This the Governor could not deny.
He said, had he thought proper to take refuge in Austria,
the Emperor Francis could not, without disgracing himself,
have denied him admission not only to his empire,
but even to his house and his family, of which he, Napoleon,
was a member. This the Governor also admitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lastly,” said the Emperor, “if, relying on my own
individual interests, I had persisted in defending them in
France by force of arms, there is no doubt that the Allies
would have formally granted me immense advantages,
perhaps even territory.” The Governor, who hesitated
for some time on this point, at length agreed that there
was no doubt the Emperor might with ease have obtained
a Sovereignty. “I did not wish it,” continued
the Emperor: “I determined on abandoning public
affairs; indignant at beholding the leading men in France
betraying their country, or at least committing the grossest
errors with regard to her interests; indignant at finding
that the mass of the representatives preferred disgrace
to death, and stooped to traffic with that sacred
independence, which, like honour, should be <em>a rocky
and inaccessible island</em>. In this state of things what
did I determine on? What resolution did I adopt? I
sought an asylum in a country which was supposed to
be governed by laws: among a people, of whom for
twenty years I had been the bitterest enemy! But what
did you do?... Your conduct will be recorded in
history to your eternal disgrace. Yet there is an avenging
Providence; sooner or later you will receive your punishment!
It will not be long before your posterity, your
laws, will expiate your crime!... Your ministers
have sufficiently proved, by their instructions, that they
wish to get rid of me! Why did not the Kings who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>proscribed me openly decree my death? One act would
have been as legal as the other! A speedy termination
to my sufferings would have shown more energy than
the lingering death to which they have doomed me.
The Calabrians have been more humane, more generous
than the Allied Sovereigns or your Ministers. I will
not die by my own hands. That would be an act of
cowardice. To overcome misfortune is a proof of a noble
and courageous mind! We mortals are bound to fulfil
our destinies. But if it be intended to keep me here, I
feel that you would be doing me a kindness in depriving
me of life; for here I daily suffer the agonies of death!
The limits of St. Helena are too narrow for me, who
was every day accustomed to ride, ten, fifteen, or twenty
leagues on horseback. The climate is not like ours:
neither the sun nor the seasons are like what we have
been accustomed to. Every thing here is hostile to happiness
and comfort. The situation is disagreeable and
unwholesome, and is destitute of water. This part of
the island is totally barren and has been deserted by
the inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor stated that his instructions required
that the Emperor should be restricted to certain limits in
his rides, and that an officer should always accompany
him. “If they had been thus enforced,” replied the
Emperor, “I should never have left my chamber. If
your instructions will not admit of greater latitude, you
can henceforth do nothing for us. However, I neither
ask nor wish for any thing. Convey these sentiments
to the English Government.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This,” said the Governor, “is the consequence of
transmitting instructions from so great a distance, and
with regard to a person of whom those who draw up the
instructions know so little.” He then endeavoured to
shift the question by intimating that, on the arrival of
the wooden house or palace, which was on its way to
St. Helena, better plans might perhaps be adopted:
that a vessel was expected, bringing furniture and stores
of provisions, which it was supposed would be agreeable
to the Emperor; that the English Government was exerting
every effort to alleviate his situation, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>The Emperor replied that all their efforts amounted to
little; that he had requested to be furnished with the
Morning Chronicle and the Statesman, that he might read
what related to himself under the least disagreeable forms:
but his request had never been complied with. He had
asked for books, which were his only consolation; but
nine months had passed away, and he had not received
any. He had desired to obtain intelligence of his wife
and son; but this had been withheld from him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to the provisions, the furniture, and the house,
that are intended for me,” continued he, “you and I, Sir,
are soldiers; we know how to value these things. You
have been in my native city, perhaps in the very house
occupied by my family. Though it was not the worst
on the island—though I have no reason to be ashamed
of my family circumstances, yet you know what they
were. But though I have occupied a throne, and have
disposed of crowns, I have not forgotten my first condition;
my couch and my camp-bed, you see, are still
sufficient for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor observed that the wooden palace and all
its accompaniments were at least an attention. “For your
own satisfaction, in the eyes of Europe,” replied the Emperor,
“but to me they are matters of perfect indifference.
It is not a house, nor furniture, that should have been sent
to me: but an executioner and a coffin. The former are a
mockery, the latter would be a favour. I say, again, the
instructions of your ministers tend to this result, and I
invoke it. The Admiral, who is not an ill-disposed man,
appears to me now to have softened these instructions; I do
not complain of his acts: his forms alone offended me.”
Here the Governor asked whether he had unconsciously
committed any faults. “No, Sir, we complain of nothing
since your arrival. Yet one act has offended us, and
that is your inspection of our domestics. It was insulting
to M. de Montholon, by appearing to throw suspicion
on his integrity; and it was petty, disagreeable, and insulting
towards me, and perhaps degrading to the English
General himself, who thus came to interfere between
me and my valet de chambre.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor was seated in an arm-chair on one side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of the Emperor, who had remained stretched on his
couch. It was dark, the evening was drawing in, and it
was not easy to distinguish objects. “Therefore,” observed
the Emperor, “it was in vain that I endeavoured
to watch the play of his features, and to observe the
impression which my words made on him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of the conversation the Emperor, who in
the morning had been reading the Campaign of 1814,
by Alphonse de Beauchamp, in which all the English
bulletins bore the signature Lowe, asked the Governor if
he was the individual who had signed them. Sir Hudson
Lowe, with marked embarrassment, replied in the
affirmative, and added that the bulletins represented his
views and opinions. The Governor, who had several
times proposed that the Emperor should be attended by
his physician, who he said was a very skilful man, on
taking his leave again proposed to send his Doctor to
Longwood. But the Emperor saw his motives, and
constantly resisted his offer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having related all these particulars to me, the Emperor
remained silent for some minutes. Then resuming,
apparently after some reflection, he said: "How mean
and disagreeable is the expression of the Governor’s
countenance! I never saw any thing like it in my life!...
I should be unable to drink my coffee if this
man were left for a moment alone beside me....
My dear Las Cases, they have sent me worse than a
jailor!..."</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THIRD DAY OF THE EMPEROR’S SECLUSION.—SUMMARY<br /> OF HIS HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>May 1st.—The Emperor kept his room to-day as he
had done yesterday. I felt ill from my ride from the Briars;
I had a slight fever, accompanied by great lassitude.
The Emperor sent for me about seven o’clock in the
evening. I went to his chamber and found him reading
Rollin, whom he accused, as usual, of being too indulgent
an historian. He did not appear to have been indisposed,
and even said he was very well; but this only rendered
me the more uneasy at his seclusion and his calmness
of manner. He put off dinner to a later hour than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>usual, and detained me with him. He called for a glass
of Constantia some time before dinner; this he generally
does when he feels the want of excitement.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, he looked over a few of the addresses,
proclamations, or acts, in Goldsmith’s imperfect collection.
The perusal of some of these documents seemed
to interest him; then, laying down the book, he began
to walk about, and said, "After all, let them abridge,
suppress, and mutilate as much as they please, they will
find it very difficult to throw me entirely into the shade.
The historian of France cannot pass over the Empire, and
if he has any honesty, he will not fail to render me my
share of justice. His task will be easy; for the facts
speak for themselves: they shine like the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I closed the gulf of anarchy and cleared the chaos.
I purified the Revolution, dignified Nations and established
Kings. I excited every kind of emulation, rewarded
every kind of merit, and extended the limits of glory!
This is at least something! And on what point can I be
assailed on which an historian could not defend me? Can
it be for my intentions? But even here I can find absolution.
Can it be for my despotism? It may be demonstrated
that the Dictatorship was absolutely necessary.
Will it be said that I restrained liberty? It can be proved
that licentiousness, anarchy, and the greatest irregularities,
still haunted the threshold of freedom. Shall I be
accused of having been too fond of war? It can be shown
that I always received the first attack. Will it be said
that I aimed at universal monarchy? It can be proved
<a id='corr120.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hat'>that</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_120.30'><ins class='correction' title='hat'>that</ins></a></span> this was merely the result of fortuitous circumstances,
and that our enemies themselves led me step by step to
this determination. Lastly, shall I be blamed for my
ambition? This passion I must doubtless be allowed to
have possessed, and that in no small degree; but, at the
same time, my ambition was of the highest and noblest
kind that ever, perhaps, existed—that of establishing and
of consecrating the empire of reason, and the full exercise
and complete enjoyment of all the human faculties!
And here the historian will probably feel compelled to regret
that such ambition should not have been fulfilled and
gratified!” ... Then after a few moments of silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>reflection: “This,” said the Emperor, “is my whole
history in a few words.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>FOURTH DAY OF ABSOLUTE SECLUSION.—THE MONITEUR<br /> FAVOURABLE TO THE EMPEROR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>2nd.—The Emperor still kept his room as on the preceding
days. He sent for me about nine o’clock in the
evening, after I had dined. He had seen no one during
the day; I remained with him till eleven o’clock; he was
in good spirits, and appeared to be well. I assured him
that the days which we passed without seeing him seemed
very tedious; and that we feared his health would
suffer from close confinement and the want of fresh air.
For my own part, this seclusion caused me great uneasiness
and affliction. He went to bed half an hour before
he dismissed me: he said his legs refused to support him.
He felt fatigued with walking, though he had only taken
a few turns with me in his chamber.</p>

<p class='c001'>He spoke a great deal of the Legion of Honour, of
Goldsmith’s Collection, and of the Moniteur. Respecting
the latter, he said that it was certainly a very remarkable
circumstance, and one of which few besides himself could
boast, that he had made his way through the Revolution
at so early an age, and with so much notoriety, without
having to dread the Moniteur. “There is not a sentence
in it,” said he, “which I could wish to obliterate. On
the contrary, the Moniteur will infallibly serve me as a
justification, whenever I may have occasion for it.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>FIFTH DAY’S SECLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>3rd.—The Emperor still continued within doors, and
saw no one; this was his fifth day of retirement. The
different individuals of his establishment knew not how
he occupied himself in his chamber. He sent for me, as
it were, by stealth, and I went to him about six o’clock
in the evening.</p>

<p class='c001'>I again expressed to him the anxiety and pain we felt
at seeing him thus secluded. He told me that he bore
the confinement very well, but that he found the days
long and the nights still longer. He had been unoccupied
during the whole day: he said he had felt himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>out of humour; and, indeed, he still continued silent
and dull. He took the bath, and I attended him. He
concluded the evening by conversing on subjects of great
importance.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>SIXTH DAY OF SECLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>4th.—The Emperor still remained within doors. He
had, however, expressed his intention to ride on horseback
about four o’clock; but the rain prevented him
from stirring out. He received the Grand Marshal in
his chamber.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sent for me about eight o’clock to dine with him.
He said that the Governor had called on the Grand
Marshal, and had remained with him above an hour. His
conversation had been frequently disagreeable and sometimes
even offensive. He had spoken on a variety of
topics in a tone of ill-humour and disrespect, and in a very
vague and indeterminate manner: reproaching us, particularly,
as it appeared, with being very loud and unreasonable
in our complaints. He maintained that we were
very well provided for and ought to be content; that we
seemed to be strangely mistaken with regard to what was
due to our persons and our situations. He added, at
least so he was understood, that he was desirous of being
assured every day, by ocular testimony, of the existence
and presence of the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that this point was the real cause of
his ill-humour and agitation. Several days had passed
without his having been able to receive any report from
his officer or spies, as the Emperor had not gone out, and
no one had been admitted to his presence.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what measures would he adopt? This consideration
occupied us all in our turns. The Emperor would
never submit, even at the peril of his life, to a regular
visit, which might be capriciously renewed at any hour of
the day or night. Would the Governor employ force and
violence to dispute with the Emperor a last asylum of a
few square feet and a few hours’ repose? His instructions
must have been drawn up in anticipation of the case that
had now occurred. No outrage, no want of respect, no
barbarity, could surprise me.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>As to the Governor’s remark that we entertained mistaken
ideas with regard to ourselves and our situation,
we are very conscious that, instead of being at the Tuileries,
we are at St. Helena, and that, instead of being
masters, we are captives: how then can we be mistaken?</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ON CHINA AND RUSSIA.—RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE<br /> TWO GREAT REVOLUTIONS IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='c007'>5th.—About ten o’clock in the morning, the Emperor
went to ride for the first time. While he was mounting
his horse, he was informed that the Resident of the East
India Company in China had come to Longwood, and
solicited the honour of being presented to him. He sent
for him, and put some questions to him with great condescension.
We then rode out to call on Madame Bertrand.
The Emperor remained there above an hour; he
was weak and altered in his appearance: his conversation
was languid. We returned to Longwood. The
Emperor wished to breakfast out of doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sent for our host at Briars, the worthy Mr. Balcombe,
and the Resident from China, who was still at
Longwood. The whole time of breakfast was occupied
in questions relating to China, its population, laws, customs,
and trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Resident stated that a circumstance occurred a few
years back between the Russians and the Chinese, which
might have been attended with important results, had
not Russia been entirely absorbed by the affairs of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Russian traveller, Krusenstern, in his voyage round
the world, anchored at Canton with his two vessels. He
was received provisionally, and was permitted, until the
orders of the Court should arrive, to dispose of the furs
with which his ships were laden, and to take on board a
cargo of tea in their stead. The orders from the Chinese
court were delayed for more than a month, and M. de
Krusenstern had set sail two days before they arrived.
They directed that the two vessels should quit the port
immediately: that all trade with the Russians in that
quarter was prohibited; that enough had been conceded
to their Emperor by land in the North of the Empire;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>that it was monstrous in him to attempt to extend his
intercourse in the South by sea; and that strong displeasure
would he manifested towards those who had suggested
to them that course. The order further decreed
that, in the event of the ships having sailed before the
arrival of the answer from Pekin, the English Factory
should be charged to communicate it, through Europe,
to the Emperor of Russia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon felt very much fatigued with his short ride;
he had not left his chamber for seven days before; this
was the first time that he had re-appeared among us.
We remarked an evident change in his countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sent for me about five o’clock; the Grand Marshal
was with him. The Emperor was undressed; he had
tried in vain to enjoy a little rest; he thought he was
feverish; the sensation proceeded from extreme lassitude.
The Emperor had a fire lighted, but would not have
candles in his room. We passed the time in desultory
conversation in the dark, till eight o’clock, when the
Emperor sent us to dinner.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of the day, the conversation had turned
on the similarity of the two great revolutions of England
and France. “There are many points, both of resemblance
and difference, between these two great events,”
said the Emperor; “they afford inexhaustible subjects
for reflection.” He then made some very curious and
remarkable observations. I shall here note down his
remarks on this occasion, as well as at other intervals
during the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Both in France and England the storm gathered
during the two feeble and indolent reigns of James I.
and Louis XV., and burst over the heads of the unfortunate
Charles I. and Louis XVI.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Both these Sovereigns fell victims: both perished
on the scaffold, and their families were proscribed and
banished.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Both monarchies became republics, and, during that
period, both nations plunged into every excess which can
degrade the human heart and understanding. They were
disgraced by scenes of madness, blood, and outrage.
Every tie of humanity was broken, and every principle
overturned.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>"Both in England and France, at this period, two
men vigorously stemmed the torrent, and reigned with
splendour. After these, the two hereditary families
were restored; but both pursued an erroneous course.
They committed faults; a fresh storm suddenly burst
forth in both countries, and expelled the two restored
dynasties, without their being able to offer the least
resistance to the adversaries who overthrew them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In this singular parallel, Napoleon appears to have
been in France at once the Cromwell and the Wm. III.
of England. But as every comparison with Cromwell
is in some degree odious, I must add that, if these two
celebrated men coincided in one single circumstance of
their lives, it was scarcely possible for two beings to
differ more in every other point.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Cromwell appeared on the theatre of the world at
the age of maturity. He attained supreme rank only
by dint of address, duplicity, and hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Napoleon distinguished himself at the very dawn of
manhood, and his first steps were attended by the purest
glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Cromwell attained supreme power, opposed and
hated by all parties, and by affixing an everlasting stain
on the English revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Napoleon, on the contrary, ascended the throne by
obliterating the stains of the French revolution, and
through the concurrence of all parties, who in turn
sought to gain him as their chief.</p>

<p class='c001'>"All the glory of Cromwell was bought by English
blood; his triumphs were all so many causes of national
mourning; but Napoleon’s victories were gained over
the foreign foe, and they filled the French nation with
transport.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Finally, the death of Cromwell was a source of joy
to all England: the event was regarded as a public
deliverance. The same cannot exactly be said of Napoleon’s
fall.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England the revolution was the rising of the
whole nation against the King. The King had violated
the laws, and usurped absolute power; and the nation
wished to resume her rights.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>"In France, the revolution was the rising of one
portion of the nation against another; that of the third
estate against the nobility; it was the re-action of the
Gauls against the Franks. The King was attacked not
so much in his character of monarch as in his quality of
chief of the feudal system. He was not reproached with
having violated the laws; but the nation wished to
emancipate and re-constitute itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, if Charles I. had yielded voluntarily, if
he had possessed the moderate and undecided character
of Louis XVI. he would have survived.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In France, on the contrary, if Louis XVI. had openly
resisted, if he had had the courage, activity, and ardour
of Charles I. he would have triumphed.</p>

<p class='c001'>"During the whole conflict, Charles I., isolated in his
kingdom, was surrounded only by partisans and friends,
and was never connected with any constitutional branch
of his subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Louis XVI. was supported by a regular army, by
foreign aid, and two constitutional portions of the nation—the
nobility and the clergy. Besides, there remained to
Louis XVI. a second decisive resolution, which Charles I.
had it not in his power to adopt, namely, that of
ceasing to be a <em>feudal Chief</em>, in order to become a
<em>national Chief</em>. Unfortunately he could not decide on
either the one or the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Charles I. therefore perished because he resisted,
and Louis XVI. because he did not resist. The one had
a perfect conviction of the privileges of his prerogative;
but it is doubtful whether the other had any such conviction,
any more than he felt the necessity of exercising
its privileges.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the death of Charles I. was the result
of the artful and atrocious ambition of a single man.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In France, it was the work of the blind multitude,
of a disorderly popular assembly.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the representatives of the people evinced
a slight shade of decorum, by abstaining from being
the judges and actors in the murder which they decreed;
they appointed a tribunal to try the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In France, the representatives of the people presumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>to be at once accusers, judges, and executioners.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the affair was managed by an invisible
hand: it assumed an appearance of reflection and calmness.
In France, it was managed by the multitude,
whose fury was without bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the death of the King gave birth to the
Republic. In France, on the contrary, the birth of the
Republic caused the death of the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England the political explosion was produced by
the efforts of the most ardent religious fanaticism. In
France, it was brought about amidst the acclamations of
cynical impiety; each according to different ages and
manners.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The English Revolution was ushered in by the
excesses of the gloomy school of Calvin. The loose
doctrines of the modern school conjured up the storm
in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the Revolution was mingled with civil
war. In France, it was attended by foreign war; and
to the efforts and opposition of foreigners the French
may justly attribute their excesses. The English can
advance no such excuse for theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the army proved itself capable of every
act of outrage and fury; it was the scourge of the
citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In France, on the contrary, we owed every benefit to
the army. Its triumphs abroad either diminished, or
caused us to forget, our horrors at home. The army
secured independence and glory to France.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, the Restoration was the work of the
English people, who hailed the event with the most lively
enthusiasm. The nation escaped slavery, and seemed to
have recovered freedom. It was not precisely thus in
France.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, a son-in-law hurled his father-in-law
from the throne. He was supported by all Europe; and
the memory of the act is revered and imperishable.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In France, on the contrary, the chosen sovereign of
the people, who had reigned for the space of fifteen years,
with the assent of his subjects and foreigners, re-appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>on the theatre of the world, to seize a sceptre
which he regarded as his own. Europe rose in a mass,
and outlawed him. Eleven hundred thousand men
marched against him; he yielded; he was thrown into
captivity, and now efforts are making to tarnish the
lustre of his memory!”</p>

<p class='c007'>6th.—The Emperor sent for me at nine o’clock. He
was vexed at the conduct of the new Governor, and particularly
at the intention that seemed to be entertained
of violating his last humble sanctuary. He preferred
death to this last outrage; and he was resolved to run
every risk in opposing it. A catastrophe seemed inevitable.
The Emperor indeed concluded that there was
a determination to bring it about, and that only some
plausible pretence was sought for. He was resolved not
to evade it. “I am prepared for every thing,” said he,
in a certain moment of confidence. “They will kill me
here, it is certain....”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor sent for Dr. O’Meara, in order that he
might learn his personal opinion. He desired me to express
to him, in English, that he had hitherto no cause
of complaint against him: on the contrary, that he considered
him to be an honest man, and as a proof of this,
he would rely implicitly on the answers he might receive
to the questions which he was about to put to him. It
was necessary, he said, to come to an understanding.
Was he to consider him as his own physician personally,
or merely as a prison doctor, appointed by the English
Government? Was he his confessor or his inspector?
Had he made reports respecting him, or was it his intention
so to do, if called upon? In the one case, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Emperor said he would readily continue to receive his
attendance, and was grateful for the services he had already
received; in the other case, he thanked him and
begged him to discontinue his visits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doctor replied with great firmness, and in a tone
of feeling. He said that his appointment was entirely
professional, and had no connection with politics; he
conceived himself to be the Emperor’s personal medical
attendant, and was a stranger to every other consideration;
that he had made no report respecting the Emperor,
and that none had yet been demanded of him;
that he could not imagine any circumstance which should
induce him to make a report, except in case of serious
illness, when it might be necessary to call in the aid
of other professional men.</p>

<p class='c001'>About three o’clock, the Emperor went into the garden
with the intention of mounting his horse. He had
been dictating for a considerable time to General Gourgaud,
and had nearly got through the events of 1815.
He was very well satisfied with the result of his labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>I recommended to him next to commence the history
of the Consulate; that brilliant period in which a nation
in a state of dissolution was in a few moments magically
re-composed, with respect to its laws, religion, morality,
true principles, and honest prejudices; and all this
amidst the universal applause and admiration of astonished
Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was in England at this time. I told the Emperor
that the mass of the emigrants were forcibly struck by
these acts. The recal of the priests and of the emigrants
was received as a blessing; and the great majority profited
by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor asked me whether we had not been
shocked at the word amnesty?—"No," I replied, “we
knew all the difficulties which the First Consul had experienced
in this respect. We knew that all the advantages
of the measure were due to him, that he alone was
our protector, and that every evil originated with those
with whom he had been obliged to contend in our favour.
Subsequently,” added I, “on our return to France, we
found indeed that the Consul might have treated us better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>with respect to our property, and this without much
difficulty, merely by assuming a silent and passive attitude.
This we conceived would have sufficed in every
case to have produced amicable arrangements between
the old proprietors and the purchasers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Doubtless, I might have done so,” said the Emperor,
“but could I have trusted sufficiently to the emigrants?—Answer
me this question.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” I replied, “now that I have more knowledge
of public affairs, and take a more comprehensive view of
things, I can readily conceive that policy required you to
act as you did. Recent circumstances have proved how
wise was the course which you pursued. It would have
been bad policy to have dissatisfied the nation. The
question of national property is one of the first bulwarks
of public spirit and of the national party.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are right,” observed the Emperor; "but I
might nevertheless have granted all that was wished.
For a moment I cherished the idea of doing so, and I
committed a fault in not fulfilling this idea. I intended
to form a mass, or a <em>syndicate</em>, of all the unsold property
of the emigrants, and, on their return, to distribute
it in a proportional ratio among them. But when I
came to grant property to individuals, I soon found that
I was creating too many wealthy men, and that they
repaid my favours with insolence. Those who, by dint
of petitioning and cringing, had perhaps obtained an
annual income of 50 or 100,000 crowns, no longer
lifted their hats to me; and far from evincing the least
gratitude, they had the impertinence to pretend that they
had paid secretly for the favours they enjoyed. This
was the conduct of the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain.
I restored the fortunes of these people, and they still remained
no less hostile and anti-national. Then, in spite
of the act of amnesty, I prohibited the restitution of the
unsold forests, whenever they should exceed a certain
value. This was doubtless an act of injustice, according
to the letter of the law; but policy imperatively called
for it: the fault was in the drawing up of the law, and
the improvidence which dictated it. This re-action on
my part, destroyed all the good effect of the recal of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>emigrants, and robbed me of the attachment of all the
great families. I might have guarded against this evil,
or I might have neutralized its effects by my syndicate.
For one great family alienated, I might have secured the
attachment of a hundred provincial nobles, and thus I
should in reality have strictly conformed with justice,
which required that the emigrants, who had all run the
same risk, embarked their fortunes in common on board
the same ship, suffered the same wreck, and incurred the
same punishment, should all receive the same indemnification.
Here I committed an <a id='corr131.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='error,'>error,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.11'><ins class='correction' title='error,'>error,”</ins></a></span> said the Emperor,
<a id='corr131.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='which'>“which</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.12'><ins class='correction' title='which'>“which</ins></a></span> the more unpardonable as I entertained an
idea of the plan which I have just mentioned. But I
stood alone, and was surrounded by opposition and difficulty.
All parties were hostile to the emigrants: and
meanwhile I was pressed by important affairs, time was
running on, and I was compelled to direct my attention
to other matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Even so late as my return from Elba,” continued
the Emperor, “I was on the point of executing a project
of the same sort. If I had had time, I should have
turned my attention to the poor emigrants from the
provinces who were neglected by the Court. It is rather
a singular circumstance that this idea was suggested to
me by an old ex-minister of Louis XVI., whose services
had been but ill requited by the Princes, and who pointed
out to me various plans by which evils of the same kind
might have been advantageously remedied.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” observed I, “the reasonable portion of the
emigrants well knew that the few generous and liberal
ideas that were cherished with respect to them originated
only with you; they were aware that all who surrounded
you wished for their destruction. They knew that the
very idea of nobility was hateful to them; and they gave
you credit for not being of that opinion. Would you
believe it, their self-love occasionally found a certain
degree of consolation in the reflection that you were one
of their own class?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then asked me what was the opinion of
the emigrants respecting his birth, the incidents of his
life, &amp;c. I replied that we beheld him for the first time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>at the head of the army of Italy; and that we were totally
ignorant of all his previous history. We never
could call him <em>de Buonaparte</em>. At this the Emperor
laughed. The turn of our conversation then led him to
observe that he had frequently reflected on the singular
concurrence of secondary circumstances which had
brought about his wonderful career.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st, “If,” said he, “my father, who died before he
attained the age of forty, had survived some time longer,
he would have been appointed deputy from the Corsican
nobility to the Constituent Assembly. He was much
attached to the nobility and the aristocracy; on the other
hand, he was a warm partisan of generous and liberal
ideas. He would, therefore, either have been entirely on
the right side, or at least in the minority of the nobility.
At any rate, whatever might have been my own personal
opinions, I should have followed my father’s footsteps,
and thus my career would have been entirely deranged
and lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>2ndly, “If I had been older at the time of the revolution,
I should perhaps myself have been appointed deputy.
Being of an enthusiastic disposition, I should
infallibly have adopted some opinion, and ardently followed
it up. But at all events I should have shut myself
out from the military service, and thus again my
career would have been changed.</p>

<p class='c001'>3rdly, “Had my family been better known, more
wealthy, or more distinguished, my rank of nobility, even
though I had followed the course of the revolution,
would have made a cipher of me and proscribed me. I
could never have obtained confidence; I could never
have commanded an army; or, if I had attained such a
command, I could not have ventured to do all that I did.
Had my family circumstances been different from what
they actually were, I could not, with all my success, have
followed the bent of my liberal ideas with regard to the
priests and nobles, and I should never have arrived at
the head of the Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>4thly, “The number of my sisters and brothers is also
a circumstance which proved of great use to me, by multiplying
my connections and means of influence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>5thly, “My marriage with Madame de Beauharnois
brought me in contact with a party, whose aid was necessary
in my system of amalgamations, which was one of the
chief principles of my government, and that by which it
was especially characterized. But for my wife, I should
not have obtained any natural connection with this party.</p>

<p class='c001'>6thly, “Even my foreign origin, though in France an
endeavour was made to raise an outcry against it, was
not unattended by advantage. The Italians regarded me
as their countryman, and this circumstance greatly facilitated
my success in Italy. This success being once
obtained, inquiries were set on foot respecting our family
history, which had long been buried in obscurity. My
family was acknowledged by the Italians to have acted a
distinguished part in the events of their country. It was
viewed by them as an Italian family. Thus when the
question of my sister Pauline’s marriage with the Prince
Borghese was agitated, there was but one voice in Rome
and Tuscany among the members of that family and their
adherents: ‘Well,’ said they, ‘the union is among ourselves;
they are our own connections.’ Subsequently,
when it was proposed that the Emperor should be
crowned by the Pope at Paris, great obstacles were, as
circumstances have since proved, thrown in the way of
that important event. The Austrian party in the conclave
violently opposed the measure; but the Italian party
decided in its favour, by adding to political considerations
a little consideration of national self-love. <a id='corr133.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='We'>‘We</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_133.28'><ins class='correction' title='We'>‘We</ins></a></span>
are <a id='corr133.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='placing,” said they, “an'>placing,’ said they, ‘an</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_133.29'><ins class='correction' title='placing,” said they, “an'>placing,’ said they, ‘an</ins></a></span> Italian family on the throne,
to govern these barbarians: we shall thus be revenged
on the <a id='corr133.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Gauls.'>Gauls.’”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_133.31'><ins class='correction' title='Gauls.'>Gauls.’”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>These remarks naturally led the Emperor to speak of
the Pope, who he said was rather favourably disposed
towards him. The Pope did not accuse Napoleon of
having ordered his removal to France. He was very
indignant at reading in certain publications that the Emperor
treated him with disrespect. He had received at
Fontainebleau every mark of consideration that he could
wish. When he learned the Emperor’s return from
Elba to France, he said to Lucien, in a tone expressive of
his confidence and impartiality, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>’E sbarcato e arrivato</em></span> (he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>has landed, he has arrived.) He afterwards said: “You
are going to Paris; make my peace with him. I am in
Rome; no cause of difference shall arise between us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is certain,” said the Emperor, “that Rome will
afford a natural and favourable asylum for my family:
there they may find themselves at home. Finally,”
added he, smiling, “even my name, Napoleon, which in
Italy is uncommon, poetic, and sonorous, contributed its
share in the great circumstances of my life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I mentioned to the Emperor, what I had already remarked,
namely, that the great mass of the emigrants
were far from being unjust to him. The sensible part
of the old aristocracy disliked him, it is true, but only
because he proved an obstacle to their views. They
knew how to appreciate his achievements and his talents,
which they admired in spite of their inclination. Even
the fanatics acknowledged that he had but one fault:
“Why is he not legitimate?” they were frequently
heard to say. Austerlitz staggered us, though it did
not subdue us; but Tilsit prostrated every thing. “Your
Majesty,” said I, “might yourself have judged of this,
and have enjoyed on your return the unanimity of
homage, acclamation, and good wishes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is to say,” observed the Emperor, smiling, “if,
at that time, I could or would have indulged in repose
and pleasure; if I had resigned myself to indolence, if
every thing had resumed its old course, you would have
adored me? But if such had been my taste and inclination,
and certainly nothing was more opposite to
my natural disposition, circumstances would not have
permitted me to act as I pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then adverted to the numerous difficulties
by which he had been incessantly surrounded and
controlled; and, alluding to the Spanish war, he said,
“That unlucky war ruined me; it divided my forces,
obliged me to multiply my efforts, and caused my principles
to be assailed: and yet it was impossible to leave
the Peninsula a prey to the machinations of the English,
the intrigues, the hopes, and the pretensions of the
Bourbons. Besides, the Spanish Bourbons were not
calculated to inspire much fear. Nationally they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>foreign to us, and we to them. At the castle of Marrach,
and at the Bayonne, I observed that Charles IV.
the Queen knew no difference between Madame de Montmorency
and the new ladies: the names of the latter
were indeed rendered more familiar to them by the newspapers
and public documents. The Empress Josephine,
who had the most delicate tact on matters of this sort,
never ceased alluding to the circumstance. The Spanish
Royal Family implored me to adopt a daughter, and
to create her a Princess of the Asturias. They pointed
out Mademoiselle de Tascher, afterwards Duchess of
Aremberg; but I had personal reasons for objecting to
this choice. For a moment I decided on Mademoiselle
de la Rochefoucault, afterwards Princess Aldobrandini;
but I wanted some one sincerely devoted to my interests,
a true Frenchwoman, possessing talent and information,
and I could not fix on one endowed with all the qualities
I wished for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then returning to the war in Spain, the Emperor resumed:—"This
combination ruined me. All the circumstances
of my disasters are connected with that
fatal knot: it destroyed my moral power in Europe,
rendered my embarrassments more complicated, and
opened a school for the English soldiers. It was I who
trained the English army in the Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Events have proved that I committed a great fault
in the choice of my means; for the fault lies in the
means much more than in the principles. It cannot be
doubted that, in the crisis in which France then was, in
the struggle of new ideas, in the great cause of the age
against the rest of Europe, we could not leave Spain behind,
at the disposal of our enemies: it was absolutely
necessary to enchain her, voluntarily, or by force, in our
system. The destiny of France required this: and the
code of the welfare of nations is not always that of individuals.
Besides, to political necessity was here superadded
for me the force of right. Spain, when she saw
me in danger, Spain, when she knew that my hands were
full at Jena, had almost declared war against me. The
insult ought not to pass unpunished: I could declare
war in my turn, and assuredly the success could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>doubtful. It was this very facility that misled me. The
nation despised its government: it called loudly for a
regeneration. From the height to which Fortune had
raised me, I considered myself called, I considered it
worthy of me to accomplish in peace so great an event.
I was solicitous to spare blood, that not a drop should
stain the Castilian emancipation. I therefore delivered
the Spaniards from their abominable institutions; I gave
them a liberal constitution; I deemed it necessary, perhaps
too lightly, to change their dynasty. I placed <a id='corr136.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='one one'>one</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.10'><ins class='correction' title='one one'>one</ins></a></span>
of my brothers at their head; but he was the only
foreigner among them. I respected the integrity of
their territory, their independence, their manners, the
remnant of their laws. The new monarch gained the
capital, having no other ministers, no other councillors,
no other courtiers, but those of the late Court. My troops
were about to withdraw: I had done the greatest benefit
that ever was conferred on a nation—so I said to
myself, and so I still say. The Spaniards themselves,
as I have been assured, thought so in their hearts, and
never complained of any thing but the forms. I expected
their blessings, but I was disappointed: disdaining
interest, they thought only of the insult: they
were indignant at the idea of an affront, enraged at the
sight of force, and all flew to arms. The Spaniards,
collectively, behaved like men of honour. I have nothing
to say on that head: but, if they triumphed, they
have been cruelly punished for it. Perhaps they are to
be pitied.... They deserved better."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor dined with us to-day; it was long since
we had enjoyed his company. After dinner he read to
us Florian’s novel of Claudine, and some extracts from
Paul and Virginia, a work which he says he is very
fond of, on account of early recollections.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Adamant transport has arrived. This vessel a
short time ago missed the island. She formed part of a
convoy, the remainder of which arrived nearly a month
back. These ships brought the famous wooden palace,
accounts of which have filled all the newspapers in England,
and probably in Europe; and also the furniture,
about which the papers have also made a great parade.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The wooden palace proved to be nothing more than a
number of rough planks, which no one knows how to
put together at St. Helena, and which it would require
several years to fit up. The splendour of the other articles
was of course well suited to our situation. Ostentation,
pomp, and luxury, were for Europe; truth and
wretchedness for St. Helena.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE ILIAD.—HOMER.</h3>

<p class='c007'>7th.—The Governor came to Longwood about four
o’clock, and went over the establishment without asking
to see any one. His ill-humour was visibly increased,
his manners had become fierce and brutal.</p>

<p class='c001'>About five o’clock the Emperor sent for me; the
Grand Marshal had been with him for some time. When
he went away, the Emperor began to talk with me upon
literature; and we reviewed almost every epic poem,
ancient and modern. When conversing on the Iliad, he
took up an edition of Homer, and read aloud several
cantos. The Emperor greatly admired the Iliad. “It
was,” he said, "like the Books of Moses, the token
and the pledge of the age in which it was produced.
Homer, in his epic poem, has proved himself a poet, an
orator, an historian, a legislator, a geographer, and a
theologist. He may be justly called the encyclopedist of
the period in which he <a id='corr137.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='flourished.'>flourished.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_137.25'><ins class='correction' title='flourished.'>flourished.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor considered Homer inimitable. Father
Hardouin had ventured to question the authenticity of
of the Iliad, and to attribute that sacred monument of
antiquity to a monk of the tenth century. This the
Emperor said was perfect absurdity. He added that he
had never been so struck with the beauties of the Iliad
as at that very moment; and that the sensations with
which it then inspired him fully convinced him of the
justice of the universal approbation bestowed on it. One
thing which particularly struck him, he observed, was
the combination of rudeness of manners with refinement
of ideas. Heroes were described killing animals for their
food, cooking their meat with their own hands, and yet
delivering speeches distinguished for singular eloquence
and denoting a high degree of civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The Emperor desired me to stay and dine with him.
“Yet,” said he, “you would probably fare better at the
table of the household; you will be starved with me.”
“Sire,” I replied, “I know that you are ill provided; but
I prefer privation shared with you to luxury enjoyed
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the day, the Emperor was ill with the head-ache,
of which some individuals of his suite also complained.
I regretted that he was unable to go out, for
the weather was very fine. After dinner, the Emperor
summoned the whole of his suite into his own chamber,
and we remained with him until ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c001'>8th.—About five o’clock the Emperor took an airing
in the calash. On his return he was visited by several
English gentlemen, of whom, according to custom, he
asked a multitude of questions. These gentlemen had
arrived by the Cornwall: they were proceeding to China,
and were expected to touch at St. Helena in the following
January on their passage back to Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner one of the suite remarked to the Emperor
that his feelings had been painfully excited in the morning
when writing out a fair copy of his dictation
respecting the battle of Waterloo, to find that the result
had depended, as it were, on a hair. The Emperor made
no reply, but, turning to Emmanuel, said, in a tone
expressing deep emotion: “<em>My son</em> (which was his
usual mode of addressing him) go and get Iphigenia in
Aulis, it will be a more pleasing subject.” He then
read to us that beautiful drama, which he admires
exceedingly.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>CHARACTERISTIC REMARKS MADE BY THE EMPEROR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>9th.—I went to dine at Briars with my son and General
Gourgaud; and we staid to a little ball. I met the
Admiral there, and I never found him in a more agreeable
humour. This was the first time I had seen him since
the adventure of Noverraz; I was aware how much the
circumstance had hurt him. He was on the point of
departing for Europe, and I knew the Emperor’s sentiments.
I was twenty times almost tempted freely to
enter upon the subject, and thus to be the means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>reconciling him with Napoleon. Truth, justice, and our
own interest, demanded this; but I was deterred by
considerations that were doubtless trivial. How often
have I blamed myself since!... But I had not
received this delicate mission, and I could not venture to
take it upon myself. The admiral might have given
publicity to the affair, and perhaps have represented it in
a way that would have highly displeased the Emperor,
and possibly have exposed him to fresh vexations. On
this subject I will note down the following remarks which
were made by the Emperor, and which characterize him
too well to be omitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was one day describing to me evils attendant on
weakness and credulity in a sovereign; the intrigues
which they engender in the interior of the palace; and
the fickleness which they create. He demonstrated very
clearly that a sovereign distinguished for these qualities
must inevitably become the dupe of courtiers and the
victim of calumny. “Of this I will give you a proof,”
said he. “You yourself, who have sacrificed every thing
to follow me; you, who have evinced such noble and
affecting devotedness, how do you think your conduct is
viewed? How do you imagine your character is estimated?
You are regarded merely as one of the old
nobility, an emigrant, an agent of the Bourbons, maintaining
correspondence with the English. It is said that
you concurred in betraying me to them, and that you
followed me hither only to be a spy upon me and to sell
me to my enemies. The aversion and animosity which
you evince towards the Governor are affirmed to be only
false appearances agreed upon between you for the purpose
of disguising your treachery.” When I smiled at
the lively turn of his fancy, and the volubility with which
he expressed himself: “You may laugh,” resumed
he “but I assure you that I am not inventing,
I am merely echoing the reports that have reached
my ears. And can you imagine,” continued he, “that
a silly, feeble, and credulous being would not be
influenced by such stories and contrivances? My dear
Las Cases, if I had not been superior to the majority of
legitimates, I might already have been deprived of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>services here, and your upright heart would perhaps have
been doomed to suffer the cruel stings of ingratitude.”
He concluded by saying: “how wretched is the lot of
man! He is the same every where: on the summit of a
rock or within the walls of a palace! Man is always
man!...”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>REMARKS ON HOCHE AND VARIOUS OTHER GENERALS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>10th.—The weather was very bad, and the Emperor,
finding it impossible to go out, walked up and down in
the dining-room. He afterwards ordered a fire to be
kindled in the drawing-room, and sat down to play at
chess with the Grand Marshal. After dinner he read to
us the history of Joseph from the Bible, and the Andromache
of Racine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Bengal fleet arrived yesterday evening. The
Countess of Loudon and Moira, the wife of the Governor-General
of India, was among the passengers.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day, in the course of conversation, the name of
Hoche having been mentioned, some one observed that
at a very early age he had inspired great hope. “And
what is still better,” said the Emperor, “you may add
that he fulfilled that hope.” Hoche and Napoleon had
seen each other, and had conversed twice or thrice
together. Hoche esteemed him even to admiration.
Napoleon did not hesitate to say that he possessed over
Hoche the advantages of extensive information and the
principles of a good education. There was, he said,
in other respects a great difference between them.
“Hoche,” said he, “endeavoured to raise a party for
himself, and gained only servile adherents. For my part,
I had created for myself an immense number of partisans,
without in any way seeking popularity. Hoche
possessed a hostile provoking kind of ambition; he was
the sort of man who could conceive the idea of coming
from Strasburg, with 25,000 men, to seize the reins of
government by force. But my policy was always of a
patient kind, led on by the spirit of the age, and the
circumstances of the moment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor added that Hoche would ultimately
either have yielded to him, or must have subdued him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and, as he was fond of money and pleasure, he doubted
not that he would have yielded to him. Moreau, observed
he, in similar circumstances, knew not how to
decide. Thus Napoleon attached but little importance
to him, and regarded him as totally wanting in ability;
without however extending this opinion to his military
talent. “But he was a weak man,” said the Emperor,
"guided by those who surrounded him, and slavishly
subject to the control of his wife: he was a general of
the old monarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hoche,” continued the Emperor, "died suddenly
and under singular circumstances; and as there existed a
party who seemed to think that all crimes belonged to
me of right, endeavours were made to circulate a report
that I had poisoned him. There was a time when no
mischief could happen that was not imputed to me;
thus, when in Paris, I caused Kleber to be assassinated
in Egypt; I blew out Desaix’s brains at Marengo: I
strangled and cut the throats of persons who were confined
in prisons; I seized the Pope by the hair of his
head: and a hundred similar absurdities were affirmed.
However, as I paid not the least attention to all this, the
fashion passed away, and I do not see that my successors
have been very eager to revive it; and yet, if any
of the crimes imputed to me had had any real existence,
the documents, the perpetrators, the accomplices, &amp;c.
might have been brought forward.</p>

<p class='c001'>“However, such is the influence of report that these
stories, however absurd, were credited by the vulgar, and
are perhaps still believed by a numerous class of persons.
Happily the statements of the historian who reasons are
divested of this pernicious effect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, returning to the former topic of conversation, he
said, "What a number of great Generals arose suddenly
during the revolution: Pichegru, Kleber, Massena, Marceau,
Desaix, Hoche, &amp;c., and almost all were originally
private soldiers. But here the efforts of nature seem to
have been exhausted; for she has produced nothing
since, or at least nothing so great. At that period every
thing was submitted to competition among thirty millions
of men, and nature necessarily asserted her rights:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>whereas, subsequently, we were again confined within the
narrower limits of order and the forms of society. I was
even accused of having surrounded myself, in military
and civil posts, with men of inferior ability, the better to
display my own superiority. But now, when the competition
will not certainly be renewed, it remains for
those who are in power to make a better selection. We
shall see what they will do.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Another circumstance, not less remarkable, was the
extreme youth of some of these Generals, who seemed
to have started ready made from the hands of nature.
Their characters were perfectly suited to the circumstances
in which they were placed, with the exception of Hoche,
whose morals were by no means pure. The others had
no object in view save <em>glory</em> and <em>patriotism</em>, which formed
their whole circle. They were men after the antique
model.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Desaix was surnamed by the Arabs the <em>Just Sultan</em>;
at the funeral of Marceau, the Austrians observed an
armistice, on account of the respect they entertained for
him: and young Duphot was the emblem of perfect
virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>"But the same commendations cannot be bestowed on
those who were farther advanced in life: for they belonged
in some measure to the era that had just passed away.
Massena, Augereau, Brune, and many others, were
merely intrepid plunderers. Massena was, moreover,
distinguished for the most sordid avarice. It was asserted
that I played him a trick which might have proved a
hanging matter; that, being one day indignant at his
last depredations, I drew on his banker for 2 or 3,000,000.
Great embarrassment ensued: for my name was not without
its weight. The banker wrote to intimate that he
could not pay the sum without the authority of Massena.
On the other hand, he was urged to pay it without hesitation,
as Massena, if he were wronged, could appeal to
the courts of law for justice. Massena however resorted
to no legal measures, and suffered the money to be paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>"O ——, Murat, and Ney, were common-place
Generals, having no recommendation but personal courage.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>"Moncey was an honest man: Macdonald was distinguished
for firm integrity; I was deceived with respect
to the character of B——.</p>

<p class='c001'>"S—— also had his faults as well as his merits.
The whole of his campaign in the south of France
was admirably conducted. It will scarcely be credited
that this man, whose deportment and manners denoted a
lofty character, was the slave of his wife. When I learned
at Dresden our defeat at Vittoria, and the loss of all
Spain through the mismanagement of poor Joseph, whose
plans and measures were not suited to the present age,
and seemed rather to belong to a Soubise than to me, I
looked about for some one capable of repairing these disasters,
and I cast my eyes on S—— who was near
me. He said that he was ready to undertake what I
wished; but entreated that I would speak to his wife, by
whom, he said, he expected to be reproached. I desired
him to send her to me. She assumed an air of hostility,
and decidedly told me that her husband should certainly
not return to Spain; that he had already performed important
services, and was now entitled to a little repose.
‘Madam,’ said I to her: ‘I did not send for you with the
view of enduring your scolding. I am not your husband,
and if I were I should not be the more inclined to bear
with you.’ These few words confounded her; she became
as pliant as a glove, turned quite obsequious, and was
only eager to obtain a few conditions. To these, however,
I by no means acceded, and merely contented myself
with congratulating her on her willingness to listen
to reason. In critical circumstances, Madam, said I, it
is a wife’s duty to endeavour to smooth difficulties; go
home to your husband, and do not torment him by your
opposition."</p>

<h3 class='c006'>RIDICULOUS INVITATION SENT BY SIR HUDSON LOWE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>11th.—At four o’clock I attended the Emperor. The
Grand Marshal entered the room, and gave him a note.
The Emperor, after glancing it over, returned it, shrugging
up his shoulders and saying: “This is too absurd!
There is no answer; give it to Las Cases.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Will it be credited? This was a note from the Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>to the Grand Marshal, inviting <em>General Bonaparte</em>
to dine at Plantation House to meet Lady Loudon, the
wife of Lord Moria. I blushed at the indecorum. Could
any thing be more ridiculous. Sir Hudson Lowe doubtless
thought the thing perfectly natural; and yet he had
resided for a long time at the head-quarters of armies on
the Continent; and taken part in the diplomatic transactions
of the time!!...</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Skelton, the Deputy-Governor of the island, who
was about to depart for Europe, came accompanied by
his wife, to take leave of the Emperor. They staid to
dine at Longwood.</p>

<p class='c001'>This worthy family, whom, contrary to our inclination,
we had removed from Longwood, whose prospects we
had overthrown by the suppression of the post of Deputy-Governor
on our arrival—this excellent family, to whom
we had been the occasion of real personal injury, is, however,
the only one in the island from whom we have experienced
invariable respect and politeness. We therefore
bade them adieu with sincere wishes for their welfare.
We shall always remember them with sentiments of the
deepest interest.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NAPOLEON AT THE INSTITUTE.—AT THE COUNCIL OF STATE.—THE CIVIL CODE.—MESSAGE TO LORD ST. VINCENT.—ON THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.—THE MARINE DEPARTMENT.—DECRÉS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>12th.—The Emperor, while walking in the garden and
discoursing on various subjects, spoke of the Institute,
the manner in which it was composed, the spirit of its
members, &amp;c. When he took his place in the Institute,
on his return from the army of Italy, he said that he
might consider himself as the tenth member in his class,
which consisted of about fifty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lagrange, Laplace, and Monge, were at the head of
this class. It was rather a remarkable circumstance, and
one which attracted considerable notice at the time, to
see the young General of the army of Italy take his place
in the Institute, and publicly discuss profound metaphysical
subjects with his colleagues. He was then called
the <em>Geometrician</em> of battles, and <em>Mechanician</em> of victory,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>On becoming First Consul, Napoleon caused no less
sensation in the Council of State. He constantly presided
at the sittings for drawing up the civil code.
“Tronchet,” he said, “was the soul of this code, and he,
Napoleon, was its demonstrator.” Tronchet was gifted
with a singularly profound and correct understanding;
but he could not descend to developments. He spoke
badly, and could not defend what he proposed. “The
whole council,” said the Emperor, “at first opposed his
suggestions;” but Napoleon, with his shrewdness and
facility of seizing and creating luminous and new relations,
arose, and without any other knowledge of the
subject than the correct basis furnished by Tronchet,
developed his ideas, set aside objections, and brought
every one over to his opinions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Minutes of the Council of State have transmitted
to us the extempore speeches of the First Consul on
most of the articles of the civil code. At every line, we
are struck with the correctness of his observations, the
depth of his views, and in particular the liberality of his
sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, in spite of the opposition that was set up to it,
we are indebted to him for that article of the Code
which enacts that every individual born in France is a
Frenchman. “I should like to know,” said he, "what
inconvenience can possibly arise from acknowledging
every man born in France to be a Frenchman? The
extension of the French civil laws can only be attended
by advantageous consequences; thus instead of ordaining
that individuals born in France of a foreign father shall
obtain civil privileges only when they declare themselves
willing to enjoy them, it may be decreed that they will
be deprived of those privileges only when they formally
renounce them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"If individuals born in France of a foreign father
were not to be considered as enjoying the full privileges
of Frenchmen, we cannot subject to the conscription and
other public duties the sons of those foreigners who have
married in France through the events of the war.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am of opinion that the question should be considered
only with reference to the interests of France.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Though individuals born in France possess no property,
they are at least animated by French spirit, and they
follow French customs. They cherish that attachment
which every one naturally feels for the country that gave
him birth; finally, they help to maintain the public
burthens.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The First Consul distinguished himself no less by his
support of the article which preserves the privileges of
Frenchmen to children born of Frenchmen settled in
foreign countries, and this law he extended in spite of
powerful opposition. “The French people,” said he,
"who are a numerous and industrious people, are scattered
over every part of the world; and in course of
time they will be scattered about in still greater numbers.
But the French visit foreign countries only to make their
fortunes. The acts by which they seem momentarily to
attach themselves to foreign governments have for their
object only to obtain the protection necessary for their
various speculations. If they should intend to return to
France, after realizing a fortune, would it be proper to
exclude them?</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it should happen that a country in the possession
of France were to be invaded by the enemy, and afterwards
ceded to him by a treaty, would it be just to say
to those of the inhabitants who might come to settle on
the territory of the republic, that they had forfeited their
rights as Frenchmen, for not having quitted their former
country at the moment it was ceded; and because they
had sworn temporary allegiance to a new Sovereign,
in order to gain time to dispose of their property and
transfer their wealth to France?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another debate on the decease of soldiers, some difficulties
having arisen relative to those who might die in
a foreign country, the First Consul exclaimed with vivacity;—"The
soldier is never abroad when he is under
the national banner. The spot where the standard of
France is unfurled becomes French ground!"</p>

<p class='c001'>On the subject of divorce, the First Consul was for
the adoption of the principle, and spoke at great length
on the ground of incompatibility, which it was attempted
to repel.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“It is pretended,” said he, "that divorce is contrary
to the interests of women and children, and to the spirit
of families; but nothing is more at variance with the
interests of married persons, when their humours are
incompatible, than to reduce them to the alternative of
either living together, or of separating with publicity.
Nothing is more opposite to domestic happiness than a
divided family. Separation had formerly, with regard
to the wife, the husband, and the children, nearly the
same effect as divorce, and yet it was not so frequent as
divorce now is. It was only attended with this additional
inconvenience, that a woman of bad character might
continue to dishonour her husband’s name because she
was permitted to retain it."</p>

<p class='c001'>When opposing the drawing up of an article to specify
the causes for which divorce would be admissible, he
said; "But is it not a great misfortune to be compelled
to expose these causes, and reveal even the most minute
and private family details?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides, will these causes, even in the event of their
real existence, be always sufficient to obtain divorce?
That of adultery, for instance, can only be successfully
maintained by proofs, which it is always very difficult,
and sometimes even impossible, to produce. Yet the
husband, who should not be able to bring forward these
proofs, would be compelled to live with a woman whom
he abhors and despises, and who introduces illegitimate
children into his family. His only resource would be
separation from bed and board; but this would not shield
his name from dishonour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Resuming the support of the principle of divorce, and
opposing certain restrictions, he continued; "Marriage
is not always, as is supposed, the result of affection. A
young female consents to marry for the sake of conforming
to the fashion, and obtaining independence and an
establishment of her own. She accepts a husband of a
disproportionate age, and whose tastes and habits do not
accord with hers. The law then should provide for her
a resource against the moment when, the illusion having
ceased, she finds that she is united in ill-assorted bonds,
and that her expectations have been disappointed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>"Marriage takes its form from the manners, customs,
and religion, of every people. Thus its forms are not
everywhere alike. In some countries, wives and concubines
live under the same roof; and slaves are treated
like children: the organization of families is therefore
not deduced from the law of nature. The marriages of
the Romans were not like those of the French.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The precautions established by law for preventing
persons from contracting unthinkingly at the age of fifteen
or eighteen an engagement which extends to the
whole of their lives, are certainly wise. But are they
sufficient?</p>

<p class='c001'>"That after ten years passed in wedlock, divorce
should not be admitted but for very weighty reasons, is
also a proper regulation. Since, however, marriages
contracted in early youth are rarely the choice of the
parties themselves, but are brought about by their families
for interested views, it is proper that, if the parties
themselves perceive that they are not formed for one
another, they should be enabled to dissolve a union on
which they had no opportunity of reflecting. The facility
thus afforded them, however, should not tend to
favour either levity or passion. It should be surrounded
by every precaution and every form calculated to prevent
its abuse. The parties, for example, might be heard by
a secret family council, held under the presidency of the
magistrate. In addition to this, it might, if thought
necessary, be determined that a woman should only once
be allowed to procure divorce, and that she should not
be suffered to re-marry in less than five years, lest the
idea of a second marriage should induce her to dissolve
the first; that, after married persons have lived together
for ten years, the dissolution should be rendered very
difficult, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To grant divorce only on account of adultery publicly
proved, is to proscribe it completely; for, on the
one hand, few cases of adultery can be proved, and, on
the other, there are few men shameless enough to expose
the infamy of their wives. Besides, it would be scandalous,
and contrary to the honour of the nation, to reveal
the scenes that pass in some families; it might be concluded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>though erroneously, that they afford a picture of
our French manners.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The first lawyers of the council were of opinion that
civil death should carry along with it the dissolution of
the civil contract of marriage. The question was warmly
discussed. The First Consul, with great animation,
opposed it in these terms; "A woman is then to be
forbidden, though fully convinced of her husband’s innocence,
to follow in exile the man to whom she is most
tenderly united; or, if she should yield to her conviction,
and to her duty, she is to be regarded only as a concubine!
Why deprive an unfortunate married couple of the
right of living together under the honourable title of
lawful husband and wife?</p>

<p class='c001'>"If the law permits a woman to follow her husband,
without allowing her the title of wife, it permits adultery.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Society is sufficiently avenged by the sentence of
condemnation, when the criminal is deprived of his property
and torn from his friends and his connections. Is
there any need to extend the punishment to the wife,
and violently to dissolve a union which identifies her
existence with that of her husband? Would she not
say:—<a id='corr149.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“You'>‘You</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.23'><ins class='correction' title='“You'>‘You</ins></a></span> had better have taken his life, I should
then have been permitted at least to cherish his memory;
but you ordain that he shall live, and you will not allow
me to console him in his <a id='corr149.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='misery.'>misery.’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.26'><ins class='correction' title='misery.'>misery.’</ins></a></span> Alas! how many
men have been led into guilt only through their attachment
to their wives! Those therefore who have caused
their misfortunes should at least be permitted to share
them. If a woman fulfils this duty, you esteem her
virtue, and yet you are allowing her no greater indulgence
than would be extended to the infamous wretch
who prostitutes herself!" Volumes might be filled with
quotations of this sort.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1815, after the restoration, as I was conversing
with M. Bertrand de Molleville, formerly Minister of
the Marine under Louis XVI., a man of great abilities,
and who has distinguished himself in more ways than
one, he said:—"Your Bonaparte, your Napoleon, was
a very extraordinary man, it must be confessed. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>little did we know him on the other side of the water!
We could not but yield to the conviction of his victories
and his invasions, it is true; but Genseric, Attila, and
Alaric, were as victorious as he. Thus he produced on
me an impression of terror rather than of admiration.
But, since I have been here, I have taken the trouble to
look over the debates on the civil code, and I have ever
since been filled with profound veneration for him. But
where in the world did he collect all his knowledge?...
I discover something new every day. Ah! Sir, what
a man you had at the head of your government. Really,
he was nothing less than a prodigy!..."</p>

<p class='c001'>About five o’clock the Emperor received Captain
Bowen, of the Salsette frigate, which is to sail to-morrow.
He behaved very condescendingly to him. In the course
of conversation the name of Lord St. Vincent, who the
Captain said was his patron, happened to be mentioned,
on which the Emperor remarked: “You will see him on
your return to England, and I commission you to present
my compliments to him, as to a good sailor, a brave and
worthy veteran.”</p>

<p class='c001'>About 7 o’clock the Emperor took a bath. He sent
for me, and we conversed for a long time, first on the
events of the day, then on literary subjects, and lastly on
geography. He expressed his astonishment that we
possessed no certain knowledge of the interior of Africa.
I told him that I had entertained the idea, some years
ago, of presenting to his Minister of Marine a plan of a
journey into the interior of Africa; not a secret and
adventurous excursion, but a regular military expedition,
in every respect worthy of the age and of the Emperor.
The Minister laughed in my face when I first conversed
with him on the subject, and looked upon the idea as an
absurdity.</p>

<p class='c001'>My plan was to have entered Africa at once on the
north, south, east, and west, and to have formed a junction
in the centre; or, if starting only from the east and
west, I proposed that the two divisions of the expedition
should meet in the centre, separate again and proceed,
one to the north, the other to the south. I thought it
probable that, after obtaining from the Court of Portugal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>all the information that could be procured, it would
be found that there already existed a communication
from east to west, or that at all events very little was
wanting to effect it. The state of public feeling at the
time, our enthusiasm, our enterprizes, our prodigies,
would have rendered it easy to procure 5 or 600 good
soldiers, with the requisite number of surgeons, physicians,
botanists, chymists, astronomers, and naturalists,
all willing to embark in the enterprize, and we should
undoubtedly have accomplished something worthy of
the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>The necessary supply of beasts of burthen, small leathern
boats for crossing rivers, skins for conveying water
through the deserts, and light manageable field-pieces,
would have rendered the execution of the enterprize easy
and complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt,” said the Emperor, “your idea would
have pleased me. I should have taken it up, submitted
it to the consideration of a committee, and brought it to
a result.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He said that he very much regretted his not having
had time, during his stay in Egypt, to accomplish something
of this sort. He had troops suited in every respect
to brave the dangers of the desert. He had received
presents from the Queen of Darfour, and had sent
her some in return. Had he remained longer, he intended
to have carried to a great extent our geographical
investigations in the northern district of Africa, and
that too by the simplest means, merely by placing in
each caravan some intelligent officers, for whom he
would have procured hostages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation then turned on the marine department.
The Emperor entered very deeply into the subject.
He could not say that he was satisfied with
Decrès; and he even thought that the confidence he
reposed in him was not altogether irreproachable. The
difficulty of finding persons better qualified maintained
him in his post; for, after all, the Emperor said, Decrès
was the best he could find. Ganteaume was merely a
sailor, and destitute of every other talent. Cafarelli, he
said, had forfeited his good opinion, because he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>informed that his wife intrigued in political affairs, which
he regarded as an unpardonable offence. Missiessi was
not a man to be depended on; for his family had been
one of those who surrendered Toulon. The Emperor
had, for a moment, cast his eye on Emériau; but, on
consideration, he did not think that he possessed adequate
capabilities. He had asked himself whether
T...... might not have filled the post; but he decided
that he was not qualified for it. He was a good man
of business, it is true; but he had plunged very deeply
into the affairs of the revolution; and what had confirmed
the Emperor in his disapproval of him was that
he had subsequently seen some of his private letters, by
which it was evident that he still adhered to his old
jacobinical sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had,” observed the Emperor, “rendered the duties
of all my ministerial posts so easy that almost any one
was capable of discharging them, if he possessed only
fidelity, zeal, and activity. I must however except the
office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which it was frequently
necessary to exercise a ready talent for persuasion.
In fact,” continued he, “in the marine department
but little was required, and Decrès was perhaps,
after all, the best man I could have found. He possessed
authority; and he discharged the business of his office
scrupulously and honestly. He was endowed with a
good share of understanding, but this was evinced only
in his conversation and private conduct. He never conceived
any plan of his own, and was incapable of executing
the ideas of others on a grand scale; he could
walk, but he could never be made to run. He ought to
have passed one-half of his time in the sea-ports, or on
board the exercising squadrons. He would have lost
none of my favour by so doing. But, as a courtier, he
was afraid to quit his portfolio. This shews how little
he knew me. He would not have been the less protected
by removing from my Court: his absence would
have been a powerful circumstance in his favour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said he very much regretted Latouche-Tréville,
whom he regarded as a man of real talent.
He was of opinion that that Admiral would have given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>a different impulse to affairs. The attack on India and
the invasion of England would by him have been at
least attempted, and perhaps accomplished.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor blamed himself for having employed the
pinnaces at Bologne. He said it would have been better
had he employed real ships at Cherbourg. He was
of opinion that had Villeneuve manifested more vigour
at Cape Finistèrre, the attack might have been rendered
practicable. “I had made arrangements for the arrival
of Villeneuve, with considerable art and calculation, and
in defiance of the opinions and the routine of the naval
officers by whom I was surrounded. Every thing happened
as I had foreseen; when the inactivity of Villeneuve
ruined all. But,” added the Emperor, "Heaven
knows what instructions he might have received from
Decrès,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> or what letters might have been privately written
to him which never came to my knowledge; for,
though I was very powerful and fond of searching into
every thing, yet I am convinced that I was far from
knowing all that was passing around me.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Grand Marshal said, the other day, that it used
to be remarked in the saloon of the household that I was
never accessible to any one after I had given audience to
the Minister of the Marine. The reason was, because he
never had any but bad news to communicate to me.
For my part I gave up every thing after the disaster of
Trafalgar; I could not be every where, and I had enough
to occupy my attention with the armies of the continent.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I had long meditated a decisive expedition to India;
but my plans had been constantly frustrated. I intended
to have fitted out a force of 16,000 troops, on board
ships of the line; each 74 to have taken 500 troops on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>board, which would of course have required thirty-two
ships. I proposed that they should take in a supply of
water for four months; which supply might have been
renewed at the Isle of France, or in any habitable spot
of the desert of Africa, Brazil, or the Indian Ocean. In
case of need, they might have taken in water wherever
they chose to anchor. On reaching the place of their
destination, the troops were to be put ashore, and
the ships were immediately to depart, making up the
number of their crews by the sacrifice of seven or eight
of the vessels which might be condemned as unserviceable;
so that an English squadron arriving from
Europe immediately afterwards would have found no
trace of ours.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the army, when abandoned to itself and placed
under the command of a clever and confidential chief, it
would have renewed the prodigies that were familiar to
us, and Europe would have beheld the conquest of India
as she had already seen the conquest of Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I knew Decrès well; we had both commenced our
career together in the marine. I think he entertained
for me all the friendship of which he was susceptible,
and I, on my part, was tenderly attached to him. It
was an unfortunate passion, as I used to say when I was
rallied on the subject, which was frequently the case,
for Decrès was very much disliked, and I have often
thought that, from some motive or other, he took pleasure
in his own unpopularity. At St. Helena, as elsewhere,
I found myself almost his only defender. I saw
a great deal of him while the Emperor was at the island
of Elba, and he was occasionally favourable to Napoleon.
We conversed candidly on the subject, and I have every
reason to believe that he observed full and entire confidence
with respect to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No sooner had your Majesty returned to the Tuileries,”
said I to the Emperor, "than Decrès and I ran
to embrace each other, exclaiming, ‘He has returned!
we have him again!’ His eyes were suffused with tears;
I must bear this testimony to his feelings. ‘Well,’
said he to me, in the presence of his wife, ‘I am now
convinced that I have often done you wrong, and I owe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>you reparation; but your old habits and connections so
naturally brought you in contact with those who are now
about to quit us that I doubted not but you would sooner
or later be perfectly reconciled with them, though you
were perhaps often offended at the expression of my real
sentiments.’”—“And did you believe this, you simpleton?"
exclaimed the Emperor, bursting into a fit of
laughter. “This was an excellent piece of courtier-like
art; a touch for La Bruyère. It was really a good idea
on the part of Decrès; for if, during my absence, any
thing offensive to me had chanced to escape him, he
would, you see, by this means, have atoned for it once
for all.”—"Well, Sire," continued I, "what I have
just told you is perhaps only amusing; but what I will
now communicate is of a more important nature:—During
the crisis of 1814, before the taking of Paris, Decrès
was sounded in a very artful way as to his inclination to
conspire against your Majesty, and he honestly repelled
the suggestion. Decrès was easily and often roused to
discontent; and he possessed a certain air of authority
in his language and manners which rendered him a
useful acquisition to any party he might espouse. He
happened, at the unhappy period I have just mentioned,
to visit a person of celebrity; the hero of the machinations
of the day. The latter advanced to Decrès, and,
drawing him aside to the fire-place, took up a book, saying,
I have just now been reading something that
struck me forcibly,—you shall hear it. Montesquiou,
in such and such a chapter and page, says,—When the
Prince rises above the laws, when tyranny becomes insupportable,
the oppressed have no alternative but....—‘Enough,’
exclaimed Decrès, putting his hand
over the mouth of the reader; ‘I will hear no more;
close the book.’ And the other coolly laid down the volume,
as though nothing particular had occurred, and
began to talk on a totally different subject."</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion, a certain Marshal, after his
fatal defection, alarmed at the unfavourable impression
which his conduct was calculated to produce on the public
mind, and vainly seeking the approbation and support
of those who surrounded him, endeavoured to interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Decrès in his favour. “I have always borne in mind,”
said he to Decrès, “one of our conversations in which you
so energetically painted the evils and perplexities that
weighed upon the country. The force of your arguments
greatly influenced me in the step which I took with the
view of alleviating our misfortunes.”—"Yes, my dear
fellow," replied Decrès; “but did it not also occur to
you that you overshot your mark?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In order that these anecdotes may be appreciated as
they deserve,” said I to the Emperor, “I must inform your
Majesty that they were related to me by Decrès himself
during your absence, and when he certainly entertained
no idea of your return.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor kept up the conversation for nearly two
hours in the bath. He did not dine till nine o’clock, and
he desired me to stay with him. We discoursed about
the military school at Paris. I left the school only a year
before Napoleon entered it, and therefore the same officers,
tutors, and comrades were common to us both. He took
particular pleasure in reverting with me to this period of
our youth: in reviving the recollection of our occupations,
our boyish tricks, our games, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this cheerful humour, he called for a glass of Champagne,
which was rather an unusual thing; for such is
his habitual abstinence that a single glass of wine is
sufficient to flush his face, and to render him very talkative.
It is well known that he seldom sits longer than a
quarter of an hour, or half an hour, at table; but to-day
we sat upwards of two hours. He was very much surprised
when Marchand informed him that it was eleven o’clock.
“How rapidly the time has slipped away,” said he, with an
expression of satisfaction. “Why can I not always pass
my hours thus agreeably! My dear Las Cases,” said he,
as he dismissed me, “you leave me happy.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DANGEROUS ILLNESS OF MY SON.—REMARKABLE OBSERVATIONS.—THE DICTIONARY OF WEATHERCOCKS.—BERTHOLET.</h3>

<p class='c007'>13th. Dr. Warden and two other medical gentlemen
came to hold a consultation on my son, whose indisposition
alarmed me.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The Emperor, at my request, consented to receive Dr.
Warden, our old acquaintance of the Northumberland.
He conversed for upwards of two hours, familiarly taking
a review of those acts of his government which had
drawn upon him the greatest share of enmity, falsehood,
and calumny. As the Doctor afterwards observed to me,
nothing could be more correct, clear, simple, curious, and
satisfactory, than these details.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor concluded with the following remarkable
observations: “I concern myself but little about the
libels that have been written against me. My acts and
the events of my reign refute them more completely than
the most skilful arguments that could be employed. I
seated myself on a vacant throne. I arrived at supreme
power unsullied by the crimes that have usually disgraced
the chiefs of dynasties. Let history be consulted, let
me be compared with others! If I have to fear the reproaches
of posterity and history, it is not for having
been too severe but perhaps for having been too indulgent!”</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor looked at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Dictionnaire
des Girouettes</cite></span> (Dictionary of Weathercocks) which is
humourously conceived, though not so well executed. It
is an alphabetic collection of the living characters who
have figured on the stage of public events since the
Revolution, and whose language, opinions, and conduct
have followed the changes of the wind. Weathercocks
are affixed to their names, with an abstract of the
speeches or a description of the acts which have procured
for them the distinction. On opening the work, the
Emperor inquired whether any of us were mentioned in it.
“No Sire,” some one present jokingly replied, “none save
your Majesty.” The name of Napoleon was indeed recorded
in the work, because, as it was affirmed, he had
first sanctioned the republic and then assumed the prerogative
of royalty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor read to us several articles from the Dictionary.
The contrast exhibited at different times in the
language and conduct of certain individuals was truly
curious; and the transition was in some instances performed
with so much coolness and effrontery that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Emperor several times suspended his reading and burst
into a hearty fit of laughter. However, after going
through a few pages, he closed the book, with an expression
of disgust and regret, observing that, after all, the
publication was a disgrace to society, a code of turpitude,
and a record of our dishonour. One article seemed to
affect him deeply, namely, that concerning Bertholet,
whom he had so loaded with favour, and on whom, he
said, he had every reason to rely.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following charming trait in the Emperor’s character
may be mentioned here, though it is pretty generally
known. Bertholet had sustained losses which involved
him in difficulties, when, the circumstance having come
to the Emperor’s knowledge, he sent him 100,000
crowns, adding, that he had reason to complain of him,
since he seemed to have forgotten that he, Napoleon,
was always ready to serve his friends. Bertholet, however,
behaved very ungratefully to the Emperor, at the
period of his disasters. His conduct deeply affected
Napoleon at the time, and he was often heard to exclaim:
“What Bertholet, on whom I thought I could rely with
such confidence!...”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the Emperor’s return from Elba, Bertholet seemed
again inclined to manifest his former sentiments of
attachment to his benefactor. He ventured to show himself
at the Tuileries, and desired Monge to inform the
Emperor that, if he did not obtain a sight of him, he
would put a period to his existence the moment he left
the palace. The Emperor could not refuse his request,
and saluted him with a smile as he passed by.</p>

<p class='c001'>During his reign, the Emperor had conferred repeated
favours on several great manufacturers, among others on
Oberkamp, Richard Lenoir, &amp;c. He wished to look for
their names in the Dictionary, but every voice was raised
to bear witness to their good conduct.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>RECEPTION OF THE PASSENGERS IN THE BENGAL<br /> FLEET.</h3>

<p class='c007'>14th.—About four o’clock a great number of visitors
came to Longwood, They were passengers who had
arrived by the East India Fleet, and the Emperor had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>signified his willingness to receive them. The party consisted
of Mr. Strange, the brother-in-law of Lord Melville,
First Lord of the English Admiralty; a Mr. Arbuthnot;
and Sir William Burroughs, one of the Judges
of the Supreme Court of Calcutta; two of Lord Moira’s
Aides-de-camp; and some others, together with several
ladies. We were all conversing together in the ante-chamber,
when the Emperor left his own room to proceed
to the garden. This circumstance excited the
curiosity of our visitors, who eagerly flew to the windows
to see him pass by:—the scene reminded us of Plymouth.
The Grand Marshal conducted our visitors to the presence
of the Emperor, who received them with the most
perfect grace, and with that captivating smile which
has exercised such irresistible power. Curiosity and
lively emotion were painted in the countenances of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor conversed with each individual, and,
according to custom, instantly seized any circumstance
that happened to be connected with their names, as he
heard them announced. He discoursed with the Supreme
Judge on legislation and the administration of
justice; with the Company’s officers on trade and the
internal Government of India. He questioned the military
gentlemen as to how many years they had served
and how many wounds they had received; he paid many
flattering compliments to the ladies, and remarked, that
the climate of Bengal had not spoiled the delicacy of
their complexions, &amp;c. Then, addressing himself to one
of Lord Moira’s aides-de-camp, he observed that the
Grand Marshal had informed him that Lady Loudon was
on the Island, and that, had she been within his limits, he
should have had great pleasure in paying his respects to
her; but that, as she happened to reside beyond the
boundaries which had been prescribed to him, he had no
more opportunity of seeing her than if she were still in
Bengal.</p>

<p class='c001'>During these conversations, in which I acted as interpreter,
Mr. Strange, with whom I had previously
been talking, drew me aside by the flap of my coat, and
in a tone of surprise and satisfaction said:—"What
grace and dignity of manner the Emperor displays!—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>shows that he has been accustomed to the etiquette of
holding a levee!"</p>

<p class='c001'>We conducted the company to the drawing-room, and
curiosity led them to take a peep at the Emperor’s
apartments. Sir William Burroughs, who, from the
post he holds, may be supposed to have some connection
with the English ministry, on entering the drawing-room
asked me whether it was our dining-room. I informed
him that it was the drawing-room, or that we might
more properly say, it was the only room in the house;
at this he was much astonished. I then pointed out to
him through the window, the two little chambers which
are all the Emperor has for his own use. His countenance
expressed regret, and he seemed, in his own mind
to be drawing comparisons between the present and the
past. Remarking the wretchedness of the furniture and
the narrow limits of our abode, he said, with an air of
concern—"You will be better provided for soon."—"How,"
said I, “is there any intention of removing us
from the Island?”—"No, but some elegant furniture
and a commodious house are to be sent to you."—"We
do not," I replied, “complain of the furniture, or the
house; but of the rock to which we have been banished,
and the latitude in which it is situated. This latitude
cannot be changed and we can never be well here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I repeated to him literally what the Emperor had, a
few days previously said to the Governor on the same
subject. Sir William was amazed, and, pressing my
hand, he said with a degree of warmth:—"My dear
Sir, he is too great and too gifted a man; we have too
much cause to dread and fear him."—"But," said I, in
my turn, “why not have driven the car of glory together,
instead of mutually destroying each other by dragging it
different ways? What might not then have been its
course?” He looked at me, and again pressing my
hand, he said with a pensive air:—"Yes, that would
doubtless have been better; but...."</p>

<p class='c001'>All were particularly struck with the Emperor’s freedom
of manner, and his tranquil expression of countenance.
I know not what they had expected to see. One
remarked that he could scarcely form a conception of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>strength of mind necessary to enable Napoleon to endure
such wonderful reverses. “That is,” replied I,
"because nobody yet well knows the Emperor’s character.
He told us the other day that he had been like a block
of marble during all the great events of his life; that
they had slipped over him without producing any impression
either on his moral or physical faculties."</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor asked us, as he often does,
what we should like to read. Some one proposed that
we should resume the Dictionary of Weathercocks; but
this the Emperor objected to, on the ground that it
served but to render his evenings the more unpleasant.
“Rather let us amuse ourselves with fiction,” said he;
and, asking for Jerusalem Delivered, he read aloud
several cantos of that poem, occasionally translating
passages into French. He then read the chief part
both of Phedre and Athalie, always expressing his great
admiration of the writings of Racine.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EQUALITY OF PUNISHMENTS.—THE EMPEROR REQUIRES ME TO GIVE HIM A DETAILED HISTORY OF MY ATLAS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>15th.—The Emperor, during his walk, conversed on
various subjects, and at length happened to light on that
of crimes and punishments. He observed that the
greatest jurists, even those who had been influenced by
the spirit of the age, were divided as to the principle of
the equalization of capital punishments. At the establishment
of the Code, he should have been averse to
equalization, had not circumstances obliged him to adopt
a contrary course. He asked my opinion: “I am,” said
I, "decidedly favourable to the inequality of punishments.
Our notions demand a gradation in punishments,
analogous to that which we conceive in crimes. The
harmony of our sensations seems to require this. I can
never bring myself to rank on a level with each other
the wretch who has murdered his father and him who
has merely committed a slight robbery accompanied by
violence. Should these two criminals be visited by the
same punishment?</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this question the criminal himself is least of all to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>be considered. The punishment is his business; and
humanity discovers many hidden modes of relieving his
physical suffering. His ideas previously to the commission
of the crime, the feelings which his punishment
creates in the minds of the spectators, and the effect it
produces on society in general:—these are the points
which must claim the attention of the legislator in deciding
the question of the equalization of punishments. It
is erroneous to suppose that death alone is sufficient, and
that the kind of death has no influence on the mind of
the criminal in the premeditation of his crime; for if
there be inequality of punishment, there is no culprit who
would not make his choice if he were permitted so to do.
Let any member of society consult his own feelings: he
would shudder at the very idea of certain punishments,
while perhaps he would be totally indifferent to certain
modes of death. The inequality of punishments and the
solemnity of executions belong therefore to the justice
and policy of civilization. Yet I conceive that it would
now be impossible to subdue public opinion on this
point.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor entirely concurred in these ideas. Having
mentioned the crime of regicide, he observed that it
might truly be said to be the greatest of all crimes,
owing to the consequences which it produced. “The
man,” said he, “who should have murdered me in
France would have subverted all Europe; and how
many times have I not been exposed to assassination!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Loudon, wife of Lord Moira, the Governor-General
of India, has been for several days at St. Helena,
where she attracts general attention. She is a lady of
high rank, corresponding nearly with a French Duchess
under the old regime. The English officers treat her
with the utmost respect. To-day the Admiral invited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>her to a little entertainment on board the Northumberland.
He sent a messenger on horseback to request me
to lend him my Atlas for the evening, in order that he
might shew it to Lady Loudon, whose husband was
described in it as the first representative of the Plantagenets,
and consequently as the legitimate heir to the
throne of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Admiral and I were on a footing of perfect indifference;
indeed we had been nearly strangers to each
other since the moment he put me ashore. The request
was not so much a mark of politeness to me, as a compliment
to the work itself. The Atlas had been the
subject of conversation, the lady had expressed a wish to
see it, and the Admiral felt a desire to shew it to her.
However, I was unable to satisfy this desire. The book
was in the Emperor’s chamber, and such was the answer
I returned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor smiled at the honour which the Admiral
had intended for me; and I could not help pitying the
amusement that had been prepared for the lady. This
circumstance led the Emperor himself to speak of the
Atlas, and to repeat some observations which had fallen
from him before. He remarked that he heard my work
spoken of at all times and in all places; that he found it
sought after by foreigners as well as Frenchmen. He
had heard it mentioned on board the Bellerophon and
the Northumberland, at the Island of St. Helena, and,
in short, every where, persons of information and rank
either knew the work, or expressed a wish to become
acquainted with it. “This,” said he, in a lively strain,
“is what I call enjoying a real triumph, a great reputation
in the literary world. I wish you would give me
the history of this Atlas. Tell me when and how you
conceived the idea of it, the manner in which it was
executed, and its results: why you first of all published
it under a fictitious name, and why you did not afterwards
affix your real name to it: in short, give me a
true and particular account; you understand, Mr.
Councillor of State?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I replied that it would be a long story; though to me
the recital would not be devoid of pleasure; for, I added,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>that my Atlas was the history of a great portion of my
life, and that, above all, I was indebted to it for the
happiness of being now near the person of the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following is the narrative, such as it appeared
when corrected after my first hasty notes. Its length,
doubtless, requires indulgence; but this I trust the
reader will be inclined to grant, on consideration that
the details which I here enter into revive the recollection
of my happiest years, of the period of my youth,
my health and strength, in a word, of the dear but brief
interval of the plenitude of life. I once more entreat
the reader to pardon the prolixity in which I have indulged;
but this statement so forcibly revives my recollections
of past happiness that even now, on reading it
over, I cannot find it in my heart to cancel any part of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>"This Work was partly the fruit of chance; but
above all, of necessity, which, as the common proverb
says, is the mother of industry.... At the time of
the first reverses of the French emigrants, I was cast
by the political hurricane in the streets of London,
without friends, without money, and without resources;
but possessing the requisite courage and willingness for
exertion. To a man animated by such a spirit, London,
at that time, afforded certain sources of emolument.</p>

<p class='c001'>"After having unsuccessfully made several applications,
I determined to rely on myself alone, and, like
Figaro, I decided on turning author. For a moment, I
had thoughts of becoming a romance writer: this idea
was suggested to me by the proposals of a bookseller;
but he required too much and was inclined to pay too
little. I then turned my thoughts to writing history,
which, at all events, was calculated to procure for me a
certain moral advantage, by storing my mind with positive
knowledge. It was then I conceived the first idea
of my Atlas, which I may truly regard as an inspiration
from Heaven, for to it I owed my life. The work was
at first a simple sketch, a mere nomenclature, very different
from the form in which it now appears. However,
it sufficed immediately to relieve me from embarrassment,
and to secure to me what might be called a little
fortune, in comparison with the miseries endured by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>other emigrants. Then, Sire, came the Peace of Amiens,
and the benefits conferred on us by your amnesty. I
was enabled to make a journey to France, merely as a
traveller, having no other object in view than to breathe
my native air and to see the French capital. There I
found myself at liberty to express my sentiments without
restraint; investigation was easy; my ideas and my
judgment were enlarged; I was master of my time, and
I undertook to arrange my Atlas in the form in which
it now appears. I proposed publishing regularly four
sheets per quarter. I was now vastly improved both in
my mind and circumstances. Interest, attention, good
offers, money and connexions, poured in upon me; and
I may confidently affirm that this was the happiest
period of my life.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In England, I had published my Work under a
feigned name, in order to avoid compromising the honour
of my own. I happened to fix upon Le Sage, just
as I might have decided on Leblanc, Legris, or Lenoir.
But I could not have made a more unlucky choice, or,
at least, I could not have assumed a more general appellation.
Sometime afterwards, a letter intended for
me passed through all the different colonies of French
emigrants in London, and was delivered by turns to
twenty-two priests, who all bore the name of Le Sage.
At length one, who had apparently discovered that the
name did not belong to me, sent me the letter in a
violent rage, observing that, when people thought proper
to change their names, they should at least avoid
taking those that belonged to other persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In France I still preserved the name of Le Sage,
which had now become identified with my Atlas. To
have published it under a new name might have led to
the supposition that it was a new work. Besides, I did
not wish to expose my own name to the chance of
failure, to the attacks of the Journals, or to the bickerings
of criticism. Even though I had been assured of
the complete success of the work, I should not probably
have felt the more inclined to affix my real name to it,
owing to a remnant of my old prejudices, of which I
could not easily divest myself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>"Certainly this literary fame flattered me not a little;
but I had sprung from a warlike race, and I conceived
that I was in duty bound to pursue fame of another
kind. However, circumstances rendered this impossible,
and I think it proper to mention that at least I was not
unconscious of the duty. I never had cause to repent
of my double appellation. Independently of my real
motive for assuming it, it diffused around me an air of
adventure and romance which was by no means disagreeable,
and which was moreover in unison with my
temper and character. It occasioned many mistakes
and humourous scenes which afforded me considerable
amusement. In England, for example, I have often,
when in company, been questioned in the most innocent
way imaginable respecting the merits of M. Le Sage’s
work; and at a boarding-school I was once addressed
in very discourteous language, because I obstinately
persisted in condemning my own Atlas.</p>

<p class='c001'>"So long as I continued myself to manage the publication
of the work, my method was to treat in person
with all who offered to set their names down as subscribers.
I had now no favours to solicit; I rather found
it necessary in some instances to guard against receiving
those that were offered. In France particularly I was
overwhelmed with acts of kindness and flattering compliments.
Some paid me these attentions because they
knew me, others precisely because they did not know
me; and all because I conducted myself alike to each.
For my part, I enjoyed the curious spectacle that now
presented itself to me. As every one who wished to
become a subscriber was obliged to give in his own
name, I took a review of many characters, whom I well
knew, and observed them in silence. I was thus enabled
to meditate at my ease on the curious diversity of opinion,
judgment, and taste. The point which one condemned
was precisely that which another most admired, which
a third declared to be indispensable, and which a fourth
pronounced to be inadmissible. Each according to
custom failed not to set forth his own opinion as the
prevailing one: it was the sentiment of all Paris and of
every body.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>"I had now an opportunity of being convinced of the
great advantage that a man derives from superintending
his own business himself, and of the important influence
of politeness and good manners in all the affairs of life.
I acceded to every thing that was proposed, I received
every hint that was suggested, and I was repaid a hundred-fold
for my complaisance. It frequently happened
that a person who had called on me, without any intention
of purchasing the work, was not only induced to
carry it away with him, but brought me ten, twenty, or
even a hundred, additional subscribers.</p>

<p class='c001'>"One described my Atlas as a classic work to the
Minister of the Interior; another recommended it to the
Minister for Foreign Affairs; a third promised to procure
for me the decoration of the Legion of Honour, and a
fourth wrote a flattering critique on the work, and got it
inserted in the public journals. Some carried their interest
and attachment for me even to a degree of enthusiasm.
Of this the following are instances. One of my
provincial subscribers, who was unacquainted with me,
wrote to request, as a particular favour, that I would
get my portrait engraved to embellish the work, offering,
in case I acceded to the proposition, to defray half the
expenses of the engraving. Another, who was the owner
of the Chateau de Montmorency, paid me a visit every
week under pretence of enquiring whether I had got
a new sheet of my Atlas ready for publication, but in
reality, as he himself assured me, to pass his happiest
hours in my society. He added that, if ever I should
take a fancy to sell my conversation as I did the sheets
of my work, it was in my power, if I chose, to ruin him.
I afterwards learned that this was a man of a very eccentric
turn; one of La Bruyere’s characters; quite after
the manner of Jean-Jacques. For a considerable time
he seemed to rack his invention to make me offers of
service in the most delicate way imaginable: he even
went so far as to throw out paternal suggestions to me.
‘<a id='corr167.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='M. La Sage,'>M. Le Sage,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_167.38'><ins class='correction' title='M. La Sage,'>M. Le Sage,</ins></a></span>’ said he, oftener than once ‘you ought
to marry. You possess qualities that are calculated to
insure the happiness of a wife, and still more that of a
father-in-law.’ I must not omit to mention that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>old gentleman had but one daughter, and she was a
rich heiress. However, the warmth of our intimacy
gradually abated, till at length I entirely lost the acquaintance.
It was not until a considerable time <a id='corr168.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='afterwars'>afterwards</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.4'><ins class='correction' title='afterwars'>afterwards</ins></a></span>
that, being on a country excursion with a party
of ladies, the sight of the Chateau de Montmorency
revived the recollection of my old friend. I related the
history of his eccentricities to the ladies who accompanied
me: their curiosity was excited, and we determined
to visit the chateau. The porter refused to admit us.
On my enquiring whether the gentleman was at his
country residence, I received for answer that he was
there, and that this was precisely the reason why we could
not be admitted. I thought it very extraordinary that
he should thus immure himself and render himself totally
inaccessible. With considerable difficulty I prevailed on
the servant to announce M. Le Sage. The sound of the
name operated like enchantment; the affront offered to
an elegant calash and rich liveries was immediately repaired.
The gates were thrown open, apparently to the
no small astonishment of the porter. The servants received
orders to show us over the building and to offer
us every kind of refreshment. We had brought with us
in the carriage provisions for a little rural repast; but a
sumptuous dinner was laid out for us in one of the best
apartments; and we could not, with any thing like a good
grace, decline accepting what was so politely offered.
All this hospitality was perfectly disinterested on the
part of the worthy old gentleman, who was confined to
his chamber by the gout. He was overjoyed at seeing
me; and he seemed to regard my visit as the return of
the prodigal son. He insisted on seeing the ladies who
accompanied me, and was carried into the dining-room
to do the honours of the dessert. One thing that amused
us infinitely was that he seemed to have no idea of the
rank of the friends by whom I was accompanied; and
he treated them like persons of inferior rank, though they
were in reality ladies of distinction. The old gentleman
would now scarcely allow me to depart; he insisted on
my repeating my visit, and said, that I and all my friends
should ever be welcome to his residence. But alas! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>could not avail myself of his kindness; for a few days
afterwards I read in the papers an account of the death
of this kind and sincere friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>"From the commencement of my greatness, I may,
under every point of view, date the termination of the
golden age of my Atlas. When I was transplanted to
Court and permitted to approach your Majesty’s person,
I conceived that I could not with propriety descend to
the details that had hitherto occupied me. I confided
the management of the copyright to one of my old college
companions, who had been an emigrant like myself,
but who did not turn the publication to so good an
account as I had done.</p>

<p class='c001'>"On entering upon my new post at Court, I was loaded
with compliments on my production; but to these I replied
indifferently, and just as one would do at a ball,
after dropping one’s mask. When it was found that I
never alluded to my work, that I never quoted from it,
and that I avoided all discussion on it, I was never spoken
to on the subject; and at length people began to wonder
how I had ever written it, and indeed to doubt whether
I had any right at all to be considered as its author.</p>

<p class='c001'>"On hearing these words, the Emperor said to me,
‘My dear Las Cases, even this doubt has found its way
to St. Helena. I have heard it affirmed that the work
was not written by you, that you purchased the manuscript
from the real author; and in support of this assertion
it has been remarked that you know nothing at
all about the book, because you never speak of it. To
these observations,’ continued he, ‘I have merely contented
myself with saying, Did you never know any
question to remain without a complete answer? Besides
I recognise throughout the whole work the style, the
very expressions, of Las Cases.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many,” said I, resuming my narrative, "will think I
injured myself by this denial; but I preferred good taste
to quackery, and I was only acting according to the dictates
of my natural disposition. Your Majesty was the
other day describing how Syees used to present himself
loaded with written plans, and at the very first word of
contradiction, as soon as he found it necessary to act on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the defensive, he would gather up his papers and be off
in a moment. This was precisely my feeling. I never
could stand up publicly to support my opinions. Before
I could do this, I must enjoy the authority of rank or
the freedom of intimate friendship: otherwise I prefer
dooming myself to silence, that is to say, when I am not
interrogated and urged to the point. But to return to
my subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>"So long as I remained in obscurity I enjoyed the
good-will of every one; but my elevation rendered me
an object of enmity, and I felt the influence of that vague
feeling of envy and malevolence which ever follows the
footsteps of fortune. The public journals, which for a
length of time had overflowed with flattery and agreeable
expressions in favour of the Historical Atlas, now
inserted some very ill-natured articles respecting the
work, and when these were traced to their source, the
writers frankly avowed that they had been occasioned
solely by changes that had taken place in political
opinions and public affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>"A report was delivered to the Institute of all the
works that had appeared for several years past; and in
this report the Atlas was very severely treated. Happening
to be one day in company with the writer of this
report, to whom I was known only by the name of Le
Sage, I expressed to him my dissatisfaction at what he
had said of the Atlas. He candidly confessed that the
work and its author were alike unknown to him; that,
having found the labour of writing the report too much
for him, he had divided the task among several other
persons. He informed me that the article on Le Sage’s
Atlas was infinitely more severe when delivered to him
than it appeared as inserted in the report. He had softened
it down considerably. ‘I can easily perceive,’ continued
he, ‘that you have enemies in the literary world,
and for these you are indebted to your habits and your
situation. You have connected yourself with a Count
somebody, who holds places at Court; but courtiers and
authors never agree well together. Those gentlemen
are, for the most part, very unlike us. It is said that,
in this curious partnership, you supply the talent and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>provides the money. What is the use of that? The
Count is only making his profit of you; your work is
good, and your bookseller would have remunerated you
for it. However, I am only repeating what I have heard,
and I advise you to what I conceive to be your interest.
If you wish to enjoy our suffrage, you must connect
yourself with us, you must identify yourself with our
doctrines, and leave the great folks to themselves.’</p>

<p class='c001'>"I replied, with all possible civility, that I was certainly
indebted to him for his kind advice, though it was
not just then in my power to follow it. I assured him
that he had formed an unfair opinion of my friend; that
our purses and our very lives were common to each
other; that our friendship and intimacy were indissoluble;
that we had vowed to live and die together, and that
nothing could induce us to break that vow. It was
altogether a truly comic scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Some time afterwards I was dining at the table of a
Prince: I was seated beside my illustrious host, and
wore a uniform covered with lace. The member of the
Institute was one of the guests. Surprise and embarrassment
were portrayed in his countenance. I spoke to him
several times; but he always drew close to his neighbours,
whispering to them, and apparently making enquiries.
After dinner, he came up to me, and very good-humouredly
begged me to relieve him from his perplexity.
He said that he perfectly recollected having had the
honour of meeting me before, but that he was quite at a
loss to comprehend the trick that I had played upon him.
I disclaimed any intention of hoaxing him. ‘All that you
have seen,’ said I, ‘and all that I have told you, is nothing
but reality and truth. The mystery is easily solved. You
then saw M. Le Sage who supplies the talent, and you
now see M. Le Comte who provides the funds. You
now understand how histories are written, and I have
learned how reports are made out.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“An equally ridiculous mistake procured for M. Le
Sage in the famous Yellow Dwarf, the honour of being set
down as a Weathercock, in quality of genealogist of the order
under the humorous name of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Parvulus Sapiens</em></span> (Little
Le Sage). For this favour, as I afterwards learned, I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>indebted to the suppression that was made during the
King’s reign of the genealogy of your Majesty, whose
descent I was supposed to have traced from Æneas and
Ascanuis. It is difficult to conceive what could have been
meant by all this, as there was nothing in the Atlas that
could either directly or indirectly have suggested such an
idea. However, at all the various times at which the
Atlas and its author were assailed, numerous zealous and
fervent partisans enquired whether I would be pleased
to permit them to take up my defence. I invariably desired
that the subject might be dropped; I conceived
that, by thus occupying public attention, I should surely
endanger my own tranquillity. I smiled at the ill-natured
attacks that were made on poor M. Le Sage; but I
should have been very sorry to have seen them extended
to his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>alias</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If however my Atlas enjoyed this general and extensive
success, it certainly deserved it. The work is indeed
adapted to every age, to every country, to every period;
it is suited to all opinions, classes and plans of education.
It is an assistant to him who wishes to learn, and a remembrancer
to him who has learned. It is a guide to
the scholar and an illustrator to the master. It embraces
chronology, history, geography, politics, &amp;c. To those
who understand it, and know how to use it, it may be
truly said to compose a whole library in itself. It is the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vade mecum</em></span> of the pupil and the tutor, of the scholar and
the man of business.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus it had an immediate sale, and never, I imagine,
did any literary work prove so productive to its author.
On its first appearance, the daily subscriptions frequently
amounted to 2 or 300 louis. During the period when I
personally superintended the publication, I calculated
that the receipts constituted a yearly income of at least
60 or 80,000 francs. It procured me a fortune. I had
no other, for the Revolution had deprived me of my
patrimony, which I had afterwards no hope of recovering;
for I had been obliged to renounce it upon oath,
before I could be permitted to set foot on the French
territory.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr172.41'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='There'>“There</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_172.41'><ins class='correction' title='There'>“There</ins></a></span> have been published 8 or 10,000 copies of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Atlas in various editions; and their sale has thrown into
circulation 8 or 900,000, perhaps a million of francs, out
of which there has been a clear profit of 300,000 francs
now in my hands. This constitutes my whole fortune,
for I possess nothing that has not arisen out of my Atlas,
and that may not be included in its accounts. On my
departure from Europe, the sum of 150,000 francs was
due to me in outstanding debts, either good or bad; and
I possessed a collection of books obtained by exchange,
worth 200,000 francs; which being divided into lots of
1000 crowns each, and exported to foreign countries,
seemed to promise certain returns. But, unfortunately,
out of all this brilliant produce, I can now only reckon
upon what I have already in my hands; the rest is involved
in so many chances that I cannot but consider it
as lost. I have no agent in Europe to manage my affairs,
for I had not time to make arrangements for that purpose;
and the details are so numerous, scattered, and diversified,
that I could not possibly give any one a clue to follow.
The outstanding debts are growing old; some of my
debtors are dead, some have left the country, and as for
the books, they are mostly scattered about, spoiled,
and lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At one time my work was on the point of ensuring
to me the possession of a brilliant fortune; but my prospects
were defeated by the vilest shuffling. The details
of this case are so curious that I cannot forbear mentioning
them to your Majesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At the commencement of the year 1813, two merchants,
who had discovered that I was the author of Le
Sage’s Historical Atlas, called on me, and offered, if I
would supply them with two millions’ worth of copies,
to pay me immediately at the rate of 20 per cent. in
ready money, and to convey the books gratis to London,
where they should still be my property and should remain
at my disposal. I stared at this—I could not conceive
what was meant, and suspected that the merchants were
hoaxing me. They, on the other hand, sought to explain
themselves, by saying that the offer was made for the
sake of procuring licences, an affair with which they
found I was totally unacquainted. On repeating this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>conversation to a friend, I afterwards learned that the
vessels which were licensed to sail to England, to bring
home colonial goods, could not leave France without
exporting goods equal in nominal value to their intended
importation. Books were included among the allowable objects
of exportation, and the merchants sought to obtain
a light freight and a high price, which, at little expense,
would entitle them to a considerable importation. My
Atlas was admirably calculated for this kind of speculation.
However, before I entered into any agreement, I
consulted the Director General of Customs, and the President
of the Committee of Exportation, by whom I was
informed that the thing was perfectly legal. With this
assurance I immediately set to work. I entered upon
one of the most curious speculations that can possibly be
conceived. Only a brief interval was allowed me for
making the necessary preparations. One hundred forms
in folio were distributed among thirty of the principal
printing offices in Paris; and from that moment the
presses were kept at work without intermission. All the
vellum paper of a certain size was bought up, and it daily
increased in price until it reached upwards of 100 per
cent. Such a general bustle prevailed among all the
printers in Paris as to alarm the police, until the affair
was fully investigated and explained. I afforded employment
either directly or indirectly to between 300 and 400
hands. At the expiration of one-and-twenty days I was
to be ready with the two <a id='corr174.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='millions,'>millions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_174.27'><ins class='correction' title='millions,'>millions</ins></a></span> worth of copies of the
Atlas, and was to receive 400,000 francs in ready
money. I was perhaps the only individual in the world
who could have engaged in such a speculation; for by a
singular chance, I had kept all my forms ready composed
by purchasing the types at a vast expense. I was now
reaping the fruits of ten years’ industry and expenditure.
This was truly a prize in the lottery. I was mad with
joy at my unexpected good fortune. But alas! I was
building on a sandy foundation, and I was doomed to pay
dearly for the few happy moments of my illusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The cynical M. de P——, the Director General
of the bookselling trade, who was my colleague in the
Council of State, seemed bent on my ruin, though I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>unable to divine the cause of his animosity. While he
was giving me every assurance of his readiness to serve
me, he was, in an underhand way straining every nerve
to injure me; and was exciting against me all the most
active booksellers, whom he had induced to become the
agents of his operations. Of these facts I can entertain
no doubt; for the letters secretly written on this subject
by P.... were confidentially communicated to
me; but motives of delicacy forbid my taking the satisfaction
of reproaching him with his baseness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He first of all intimated to me that the sheets of my
Atlas could not be carried out of France, because the
law permitted the exportation of books only. I then
enquired whether books in sheets were suffered to be exported;
and, on receiving an answer in the affirmative,
I observed that my sheets must be considered merely as
unbound books. M. de P.... then declared that
the favour granted by the Emperor could be extended
only to booksellers and not to authors; but M. de Montalivet,
the Minister of the Interior, objected to this
partiality and silenced M. de P..... The latter then
asserted that the price of my sheets had been considerably
encreased; but it was proved by reference to two hundred
advertisements inserted in the Journals during the
last ten years, that the price had never varied. He next
alluded to the intrinsic value of the work, and affirmed
that what I sold for 100 sous did not cost me more than
five or six, and started many other difficulties of an
equally absurd kind. Meanwhile time was flying; the
ships were taking in their freights, the advantages offered
by the owners were diminishing, the arbitrary valuations
of the committees arrived, and I, who had persevered
in my operations in spite of every difficulty, now
found myself involved in a thousand anxieties and vexations,
and thought myself happy in escaping absolute
ruin, and being able to recover my expenses, which exceeded
80,000 francs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” said the Emperor, “this seems almost incredible;
I can scarcely conceive how all this happened.
Your speculation was exactly suited to my taste; it
would have advanced you in my good opinion; I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>have been delighted with your activity and the method
of your details. Nothing afforded me greater pleasure
than to enable those around me to make their fortunes
by honest means. Why did you not appeal to me? Why
did you not expose the conduct of P....? You
should have seen how I would have treated him.”—"Sire,"
I replied, "such an idea never entered my mind,
the moment was critical: your time was precious. How
could I hope that your Majesty would listen to me, or
that I could satisfactorily explain an affair so complicated
and delicate? How could I convince you that I was the
author of a work that bore the name of another? What
would have been thought of one so near your Majesty’s
person meddling with commercial licenses and bookselling
speculations? I felt that I was so little known to your
Majesty that I dreaded the thought of the affair reaching
your ear. Thus, though I was actively engaged in
this affair, yet I exerted every endeavour to prevent its
gaining publicity, and I made up my mind to suffer the
worst."</p>

<p class='c001'>“You were very wrong,” said the Emperor. “You behaved
rather awkwardly towards me and perhaps also
towards P....; I cannot otherwise explain the
unnatural malignity which he evinced towards you.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE GOVERNOR’S VISIT.—HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE<br /> EMPEROR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>16th.—The breach between the Governor and ourselves
had been decided ever since the occurrence of
what I have already set down as his first ill-natured trick,
his first insult, &amp;c. Our reserve and mutual dislike encreased
every day; in short, we were on very bad terms
with each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>He appeared at Longwood about three o’clock, accompanied
by his military secretary, and desired to see the
Emperor, as he wished to speak with him on business.
The Emperor was rather unwell and was not yet dressed;
however, he said he would see the Governor as soon as
he had finished dressing. In the course of a few
minutes, he entered the drawing-room, and I introduced
Sir Hudson Lowe.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>As I was waiting in the ante-chamber with the military
secretary, I could hear, from the Emperor’s tone of voice,
that he was irritated, and that the conversation was
maintained with great warmth. The interview was very
long, and very clamorous. On the Governor’s departure,
I went to the garden, whither the Emperor had
sent for me. He had not been well for the last two
days, and this affair completely upset him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Las Cases,” said he, on perceiving me, “we
have had a violent scene. I have been thrown quite out
of temper! They have now sent me worse than a gaoler!
Sir Hudson Lowe is a downright executioner! I received
him to-day with my stormy countenance, my head inclined,
and my ears pricked up. We looked most furiously
at each other. My anger must have been powerfully
excited, for I felt a vibration in the calf of my left
leg. This is always a sure sign with me; and I have
not felt it for a long time before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor had opened the conversation with an
air of embarrassment, and in broken sentences. He
said, some planks of wood had arrived.... The
newspapers must have made Napoleon acquainted with
this circumstance.... They were intended for
the construction of a residence for him.... He should
be glad to know what he thought of it ... &amp;c. To
this the Emperor replied only by a very significant look.
Then adverting hastily to other subjects, he told the Governor
with warmth, that he asked him for nothing, and
that he would receive nothing at his hands; and that he
merely desired to be left undisturbed. He added that,
though he had much cause to complain of the Admiral,
he had never had reason to think him totally destitute of
feeling; that, though he found fault with him, he had
nevertheless always received him in perfect confidence;
but that, during the month that Sir Hudson Lowe had
been on the island, he had experienced more causes of
irritation than during the six preceding months.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor having observed that he did not come
to receive a lesson, the Emperor replied, "But that is
no proof that you do not need one. You tell me, Sir,
that your instructions are much more rigid than those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>that were given to the Admiral. Do they direct that I
should suffer death by the sword or by poison? No act
of atrocity would surprise me on the part of your ministers!
If my death is determined on, execute your orders.
I know not how you will administer the poison; but, as
for putting me to death by the sword, you have already
found the means of doing that. If you should attempt,
as you have threatened, to violate the sanctuary of my
abode, I give you fair warning that the brave 53rd shall
enter only by trampling over my corse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On hearing of your arrival, I congratulated myself
in the hope of meeting with a general who, having spent
some portion of his life on the Continent, and having
taken part in important public affairs, would know how
to act in a becoming way to me; but I was grossly deceived.”
The Governor here said that, as a soldier, his
conduct had been conformable with the interests and
forms of his country. On which the Emperor replied,
“Your country, your government, and yourself, will be
overwhelmed with disgrace for your conduct to me; and
this disgrace will extend to your posterity. Was there
ever an act of more refined cruelty than yours, Sir, when,
a few days ago, you invited me to your table by the title
of <em>General Bonaparte</em>, with the view of rendering me
an object of ridicule or amusement to your guests?
Would you have proportioned the extent of your respect
to the title you were pleased to give me? I am not General
Bonaparte to you. It is not for you or any one in
the world to deprive me of dignities which are fairly my
own. If Lady Loudon had been within my boundaries,
I should undoubtedly have visited her, because I do not
stand upon strict etiquette with a woman; but I should
nevertheless have considered that I was conferring an
honour upon her. I have been told, you propose that
some of the officers of your staff should accompany me
in my rides about the Island, instead of the officer established
at Longwood. Sir, when soldiers have been
christened by the fire of the battle-field, they have all
one rank in my eyes. It is not the sight of any particular
uniform that offends me here, but the obligation of
seeing soldiers at all; since this must be regarded as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>tacit concession of the point which I dispute. I am not
a prisoner of war; and I cannot, therefore, submit to the
regulations required in such a situation. I am placed in
your power only by the most horrible breach of confidence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor, on taking leave, requested to be allowed
to present his Military Secretary to the Emperor;
but the latter replied that that was very unnecessary, and
that if the officer had any delicacy of feeling he could
not wish it; for his own part he would rather decline it.
He added that no social relationship could exist between
gaolers and prisoners; and that the presentation was
therefore perfectly useless. He then dismissed the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Grand Marshal joined us; he came from his own
house, where the Governor had alighted both before and
after his visit to the Emperor. He gave a detailed
account of both his calls.</p>

<p class='c001'>He said that the Governor on his return had shown
great ill-humour, and had complained very much of the
Emperor’s temper. Not relying sufficiently on his own
wit, he had recourse to that of the Abbé de Pradt, whose
work had just then passed through our hands. He had
said, “that Napoleon was not content with having created
to himself an imaginary France, an imaginary Spain, and
an imaginary Poland, but that he now wished to create
<em>an imaginary St. Helena</em>.” On hearing this, the Emperor
could not refrain from laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>We then drove out in the calash, and on our return
the Emperor took a bath. He sent for me, and having
intimated that he would not dine till nine o’clock, kept
me with him. He talked over the affairs of the day, and
dwelt on the abominable treatment he suffered, the atrocious
malignity by which it was dictated, and the brutality
with which it was executed. After a few moments
of silence and reflection, he exclaimed, as he frequently
does, “My dear Las Cases, they will kill me here! It is
certain!” What a horrible prophecy!...</p>

<p class='c001'>He dismissed me at half-past ten.</p>

<p class='c001'>17th.—I was very ill the whole of the night; the
Emperor breakfasted in the garden, and sent for me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>attend him there. He was himself dull and melancholy,
and was not at all well. After breakfast we walked for
a long time in the garden; he uttered not a word. The
heat obliged him to return in-doors about ten o’clock.
He regretted excessively the want of shade.</p>

<p class='c001'>About four o’clock he sent to know how I was. He
had just returned from taking a drive in the calash, in
which I had not been able to join him. I walked with
him and the Grand Marshal until half past five. He
still had a melancholy and abstracted air. He desired
Bertrand to give us an account of his residence at Constantinople
in 1796, his journey to Athens, and his return
across Albania. A great deal was said relative to
Selim III. and his improvements, the Baron de Tott, &amp;c.
The conversation was very interesting, but unfortunately
I find in my manuscript only a few imperfect notes,
which my memory cannot now assist me in filling up.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner the Emperor, who had scarcely eaten any
thing, attempted to read to us the meeting of the academy
from Anacharsis. His voice and his whole frame
had lost their wonted vigour and spirit. Contrary to
his custom, he ended without analysis or observation.
He retired to rest as soon as the chapter was concluded.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MADAME MARSHAL LEFEVRE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>18th.—The Emperor continued indisposed. On his
return from a drive in the calash, he took a bath, and
sent for me. He shewed a cheerfulness of manner; and
we conversed till half-past eight <a id='corr180.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='o’clock,'>o’clock.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_180.28'><ins class='correction' title='o’clock,'>o’clock.</ins></a></span> He ordered
dinner in his own study; and he desired me to stay and
dine with him. The place, the tête-a-tête, the elegance of
the dinner service, and the neatness with which the table
was laid out, gave me, I said, an idea of comfort; the
Emperor smiled at my observation. He asked me many
questions relative to London, my emigration, the French
Princes, and the Bishop of Arras. He himself recurred
to the principal events of his Consulship, and gave me
some curious details and anecdotes on these subjects.
We then began to talk about the old and new courts of
France, &amp;c. Many of the observations that were made
would, if stated here, only be repetitions, for I believe I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>have mentioned them before. Other remarks that fell
from the Emperor, and which are merely hinted at in my
manuscript, must remain for ever lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will transcribe only the following particulars as new.
I was entertaining the Emperor with the anecdotes and
ridiculous stories, that were related gratuitously, no
doubt, of Madame Lefèvre, who long enjoyed the privilege
of furnishing the drawing-rooms of Paris, and even
the drawing-room of the Tuileries, with a subject for
quizzing. “I joined in the ridicule,” said I, "like every
body else, until one day I renounced it for ever, on
hearing an anecdote which proved her nobleness of
sentiment and goodness of heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Madame Lefèvre, whose husband was once a private
in the guards, and who consequently filled a humble
station in life, seemed to take pleasure in reviving the
recollection of circumstances connected with her former
station, and even in alluding to the laborious occupations
which she had been obliged to pursue. During their
poverty, she and her husband had been engaged in a domestic
capacity in the family of the Marquis de Valady,
the Captain of the corps in which Lefèvre served. The
Marquis, who stood godfather to Lefèvre’s child, played
a conspicuous part in the desertion of the guards, nor
was he less celebrated for his fanatical zeal in favour of
republican liberty; he was nevertheless a man of generous
sentiments. He was a member of the Convention,
and he perished because he opposed the execution of
Louis XVI., publicly declaring that he considered it as
absolute murder, adding, that Louis had already been too
unfortunate as a King to render the infliction of any
additional punishment necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The wife of the Marquis on her return to France
after her emigration, immediately received the kindest
offers and attentions from the family of Lefèvre, who
were then living in a style of considerable splendour.</p>

<p class='c001'>"One day, Madame Lefèvre called upon her, and, in
her usual strain of language, said, ‘How little kindness
and goodness of heart there is among you people of
quality. We, who have risen from the ranks, know our
duty better. We have just heard that M——, one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>our old officers, and your husband’s comrade, has returned
from his emigration, and that he is dying for
want! How shameful this is. We were fearful of offending
him by offering him assistance; but the case is quite
different with you. An act of service on your part will
be gratifying to him. Pray give him this as coming from
yourself.’ With these words, she presented to her friend
a rouleau of 100 louis, or 1000 crowns. From that
moment, Sire," said I, “I felt no inclination to join in
the jokes against Madame Lefèvre; I no longer entertained
towards her any other feeling than that of profound
respect. I eagerly advanced to take her hand
whenever I met her at the Tuileries, and I felt proud in
escorting her through the drawing-room, in spite of the
sneers that were buzzing around me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We then related a number of traits of generosity exercised
by the new favourites of fortune towards the old
ruined families. Among others, we adverted to an instance
of courtesy, perhaps somewhat far-fetched, in a
certain individual, who, being originally a private soldier,
attained the rank of Marshal, or General-in-chief, I
forget which. One day, during his newly acquired splendour,
he assembled together at a family dinner his former
colonel, and four or five officers of the regiment, whom
he received in his original uniform of a private, and he
addressed his guests in the same terms which he had
been in the habit of employing before he attained his
elevated rank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And this,” observed the Emperor, “was the only
way to soften down the fury of the times; for such acts
as these must necessarily have created mutual feelings
of kindness between the opposite parties; and we may
naturally suppose that, during recent events, the persons
thus obliged will have returned the obligations they
received, were it only for the sake of being <em>quits</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This word <em>quits</em> reminds me of a characteristic trait of
the Emperor, which must be noticed here.</p>

<p class='c001'>A General had been guilty of irregularities in his
department, which, had they been brought before the
tribunals, must have cost him his honour, and perhaps
his life. Now, this general had rendered the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>important services to Napoleon on the day of Brumaire.
The Emperor sent for, and reproached him with his
misconduct. “However,” said he, “you have laid me
under obligations, which I have not forgotten. I am
perhaps about to transgress the laws, and to fail in my
duty. I pardon you, Sir; begone; but know that from
this day forward we are <em>quits</em>. Take care of yourself
for the future, I shall look sharply after you.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE GOVERNOR OF JAVA.—DOCTOR WARDEN.—FAMILIAR CONVERSATION OF THE EMPEROR RELATIVE TO HIS FAMILY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>19th.—Doctor Warden breakfasted with me to-day.
The Governor of Java (Sir Stamford Raffles) and his
staff, who had touched at St. Helena on their way to
Europe, arrived at Longwood while we were at breakfast.
Governor Raffles was well acquainted with all the
Dutch gentlemen, whom I had seen in 1810, during my
mission to Amsterdam. The Emperor told me that he
would probably receive his visitors about three or four
o’clock. In the mean time, I conversed for several hours
with Doctor Warden, whom I furnished with some
explanations on historical facts relating to the Emperor,
about which I supposed he intended to write.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>About three o’clock the Emperor received in the
garden the English gentlemen who had come from Java.
He afterwards took a drive in the calash.</p>

<p class='c001'>On his return, about six o’clock, he desired me to
follow him to his study. He sent for the Grand Marshal
and his Lady, and conversed familiarly, until dinner
time, on various subjects relating to his family and his
minutest domestic affairs during the period of his power.
He dwelt particularly on the Empress Josephine. “They
lived together,” he said, “like a private citizen and his
wife. They were most affectionate and united, having
for a long period occupied but one chamber and one
bed. These are circumstances,” said the Emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“which exercise great influence over the happiness of a
family, securing the reputation of the wife and the confidence
of the husband, and preserving union and good
conduct on both sides. A married couple,” continued
he, “may be said never to lose sight of one another,
when they pass the night together; otherwise they soon
become estranged. Thus, as long as this practice was
continued, none of my thoughts or actions escaped the
notice of Josephine. She observed, seized, and comprehended
every thing. This circumstance was sometimes
not altogether without its inconvenience to myself and
to public affairs: but, while we were at the camp of
Boulogne, a moment of ill-humour put an end to this
state of things.” Certain political events which had
occurred at Vienna, together with the report of the
coalition which took place in 1805, had occupied the
attention of the First Consul throughout the whole of
the day, and a great part of the night. He retired to
bed not in very good spirits, and he found Josephine in
a violent rage at his long absence. Jealousy was the
real or pretended cause of this ill-humour. Napoleon
grew angry in his turn, threw off the yoke of subjection,
and could never be brought to submit to it again. At
the time of his second marriage, the Emperor was fearful,
he said, “lest Maria Louisa might exact similar
obedience, for in that case he must have yielded. It is
the true right and privilege of a wife,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A son by Josephine,” continued the Emperor,
"would have completed my happiness, not only in a
political point of view, but as a source of domestic
felicity.</p>

<p class='c001'>"As a political result, it would have secured to me
the possession of the throne; the French people would
have been as much attached to the son of Josephine as
they were to the King of Rome; and I should not have
set my foot on an abyss covered with flowers. But how
vain are all human calculations! Who can pretend to
decide what may lead to happiness or unhappiness in
this life!</p>

<p class='c001'>"Still I cannot help believing that such a pledge of
our union would have proved a source of domestic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>felicity; it would have put an end to the jealousy of
Josephine, by which I was continually harassed, and
which after all was the offspring of policy rather than of
sentiment. Josephine despaired of having a child, and
she in consequence looked forward with dread to the
future. She was well aware that no marriage is perfect
without children; and at the period of her second
nuptials there was no longer any probability of her
becoming a mother. In proportion as her fortunes
advanced, her alarm increased. She availed herself of
every resource of medicine; and sometimes almost persuaded
herself that her remedies had proved successful.
When, at length, she was compelled to renounce all
hope, she suggested to her husband the expediency of
resorting to a great political deception; and she even
went so far as directly to propose the adoption of such
a measure.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Josephine possessed in an eminent degree the taste
for luxury, gaiety, and extravagance, natural to Creoles.
It was impossible to regulate her expenditure; she was
constantly in debt; and thus there was always a grand
dispute when the day of payment arrived. She was
frequently known to direct her tradesmen to send in only
half their accounts. Even at the Island of Elba, Josephine’s
bills came pouring in upon me from all parts of
Italy."</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one who knew the Empress Josephine at
Martinique communicated to the Emperor many particulars
relative to her family and her youthful days.
During her childhood, it was several times predicted that
she would wear a crown. Another circumstance not
less curious and remarkable is that the phial, containing
the holy oil used at the coronation of the Kings of
France, is said to have been broken by Josephine’s first
husband, General Beauharnais, who, at a moment when
the tide of popular favour was running against him,
hoped by this act to gain reputation.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A thousand stories have been told and written respecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the marriage of Napoleon and Josephine. The
campaigns of Italy explain the circumstance that first
brought about their acquaintance and their union. After
Vendemiaire, Eugène, who was yet a child, presented
himself to General Bonaparte, then General-in-chief of
the army of the Interior, to request that his father’s
sword might be restored to him. Lemarrois, one of
Napoleon’s aides-de-camp, introduced the boy, who, the
moment he beheld the sword, burst into tears. The
General-in-chief was moved by this incident, and loaded
the boy with caresses. When Eugène described the
manners of the young General to his mother, she lost no
time in introducing herself to him. “It is well known,”
said the Emperor, "that she put faith in presentiments
and prophecies. In her childhood, some fortuneteller
had predicted that she would attain splendid rank, and
would even ascend a throne. She moreover possessed a
considerable share of art; and, after we became acquainted,
she frequently assured me that her heart beat
when she first heard Eugène describe me, and that
she then caught a glimpse of her future greatness and
the accomplishment of the prophecies respecting her
fate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another peculiar shade in the character of Josephine,”
said the Emperor, “was her constant habit of
negation. At all times, and whatever question I put to
her, her first movement was negative, her first answer
<em>No</em>; and this <em>no</em>,” continued the Emperor, “was not
precisely a falsehood, but merely a precaution, or a defence.”—"This,"
observed Madame Bertrand, “is a
characteristic distinction between our sex and yours.”—"But,
after all, Madam," resumed the Emperor, "this
distinction arises only from the difference of education.
You love, and you are taught to say <em>no</em>; we, on the
contrary, take a pride in declaring that we love, whether
we really do or not. This is the whole course of the
opposite conduct of the two sexes. We are not, and
never can be, similar.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“During the reign of terror,” said the Emperor,
“Josephine was thrown into prison, while her husband
perished on the scaffold. Her son Eugène was bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>apprentice to a joiner, which trade he actually learned.
Hortense had no better prospects. She was, if I mistake
not, sent to learn the business of a sempstress.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fouché was the first who ventured to touch the fatal
string of the Imperial divorce. He took upon himself,
without any instructions, to advise Josephine to dissolve
her marriage for the welfare of France. Napoleon, however,
conceived that the proper moment had not yet arrived.
The step taken by Fouché was a source of great
vexation and trouble: it very much displeased the Emperor,
and if, at the earnest solicitation of Josephine, he
did not dismiss Fouché, it was because he had himself
secretly determined on the divorce, and he did not wish,
by thus punishing his minister, to give any check to
public opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, it is but justice to observe that, as soon as
the Emperor shewed himself resolved on the divorce,
Josephine consented to it. It cost her, it is true, a severe
sacrifice: but she submitted without murmuring,
and without attempting to avail herself of those obstacles
which she might, however uselessly, have opposed to the
measure.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> She conducted herself with the utmost grace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and address. She desired that the Viceroy might be
put at the head of this affair, and she herself made
offers of service to the house of Austria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Josephine would willingly have seen Maria Louisa.
She frequently spoke of her with great interest, as well
as of the young King of Rome. Maria Louisa, on her
part, behaved wonderfully well to Eugène and Hortense;
but she manifested the utmost dislike and even jealousy
of Josephine. “I wished one day to take her to Malmaison,”
said the Emperor; “but she burst into tears
when I made the proposal. She said she did not object
to my visiting Josephine, only she did not wish to know
it. But whenever she suspected my intention of going
to Malmaison, there was no stratagem which she did
not employ for the sake of annoying me. She never
left me; and, as these visits seemed to vex her exceedingly,
I did violence to my own feelings and scarcely
ever went to Malmaison. Still, however, when I did
happen to go, I was sure to encounter a flood of tears
and a multitude of contrivances of every kind. Josephine
always kept in view the example of the wife of
Henry IV., who, as she observed, lived in Paris, visited
the Court, and attended the coronation after her divorce.
But she remarked that her own situation was still preferable,
for she already had children of her own, and could
not hope to have more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Josephine possessed a perfect knowledge of all the
different shades of the Emperor’s character, and she
evinced the most exquisite tact in turning this knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>to the best account. “For example,” said the Emperor,
“she never solicited any favour for Eugène, or
thanked me for any that I conferred on him. She never
even shewed any additional complaisance or assiduity, at
the moment when the greatest honours were lavished
on him. Her grand aim was to prove that all this was
my affair, and not hers, and that it tended to my advantage.
Doubtless she entertained the idea that one
day or other I should adopt Eugène as my successor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said he was well convinced that he was
the individual whom Josephine loved best in all the world:
and he added, with a smile, that he was sure she would
have relinquished any assignation to attend him. She
never failed to accompany him on all his journeys. Neither
fatigue nor privation could daunt her; and she employed
importunity and even artifice to gain her point. "If I
stepped into my carriage at midnight, to set out on the
longest journey, to my surprise I found Josephine all ready
prepared, though I had had no idea of her accompanying
me. ‘But,’ I would say to her, ‘You cannot possibly
go, the journey is too long and will be too fatiguing
for you.’—‘Not at all,’ Josephine would reply. ‘Besides,
I must set out instantly.’—‘Well, I am quite
ready.’—‘But you must take a great deal of luggage.’—‘Oh,
no! every thing is packed up;‘ and I was generally
obliged to yield. In a word, Josephine rendered
her husband happy, and constantly proved herself his
sincerest friend. At all times and on all occasions, she
manifested the most perfect submission and attachment;
and thus I shall never cease to remember her with tenderness
and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Josephine,” continued the Emperor, “placed the
qualities of submission, obedience, and complaisance in her
sex on a level with political address; and she often condemned
the conduct of her daughter Hortense and her
relation Stephanie, who lived on very bad terms with
their husbands, frequently indulging in caprice, and pretending
to assert their independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Louis,” said the Emperor, “had been spoiled by
reading the works of Rousseau. He contrived to agree
with his wife only for a few months. There were faults
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>on both sides. On the one hand, Louis was too teazing
in his temper, and on the other Hortense was too volatile.
They were attached to each other at the time of
their marriage, which was agreeable to their mutual
wishes. The union was, however, contrived by Josephine,
who had her own views in promoting it. I, on
the contrary, would rather have extended my connection
with other families, and for a moment I had an idea of
forming a union between Louis and a niece of M. de Talleyrand’s,
who was afterwards Madame Juste de Noailles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The most ridiculous reports were circulated respecting
an improper intercourse between Napoleon and
Hortense, and it was even affirmed that the latter had
had a child by the Emperor. “Such a connection,” said
he, "would have been wholly repugnant to my ideas;
and those who knew anything of the morality of the
Tuileries must be aware that I need not have been
reduced to so unnatural and revolting a choice. Louis
knew perfectly well the value to which these reports
were entitled; but his vanity and irritability of temper
were nevertheless offended by them, and he frequently
alluded to them as a ground for reproaching his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But Hortense,” continued the Emperor, "the virtuous,
the generous, the devoted Hortense, was not entirely
faultless in her conduct towards her husband. This
I must acknowledge, in spite of all the affection I bore
her, and the sincere attachment which I am sure she
entertained for me. Though Louis’ whimsical humours
were in all probability sufficiently teasing, yet he loved
Hortense; and in such a case a woman should learn to
subdue her own temper, and endeavour to return her
husband’s attachment. Had she known how to repress
her temper she would have spared herself the vexation
of her late lawsuit; she would have passed a happier
life; she would have accompanied her husband to Holland,
and would have staid there. Louis would not then
have fled from Amsterdam; and I should not have been
compelled to unite his kingdom to mine, a measure
which contributed to ruin my credit in Europe. Many
other events might also have taken a different turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Princess of Baden,” continued the Emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>"pursued a wiser course. On witnessing Josephine’s
divorce, she recollected her own situation, and used
every endeavour to gain her husband’s affections. They
were afterwards a most happy couple.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Pauline was too careless and extravagant. She
might have been immensely rich, considering all that I
gave her; but she gave all away in her turn. Her
mother frequently lectured her on this subject, and told
her that she would die in a hospital. <em>Madame</em>, however,
carried her parsimony to a most ridiculous extreme.
I offered to furnish her with a very considerable monthly
income, on condition that she would spend it. She,
on the other hand, was very willing to receive the money
provided she were permitted to hoard it up. This arose
not so much from covetousness as excess of foresight;
all her fear was that she might one day be reduced to
beggary. She had known the horrors of want, and they
now constantly haunted her imagination. It is, however,
but just to acknowledge that she gave a great deal to
her children in secret. She is indeed a kind mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless,” continued the Emperor, “this
woman, who was so reluctant to part with a single crown,
would willingly have given me her all, on my return
from the Island of Elba; and after the battle of Waterloo,
she would have surrendered to me all she possessed
in the world, to assist me in re-establishing my affairs.
This she offered to do; and would, without a murmur,
have doomed herself to live on brown bread.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Loftiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of sentiment still reigned paramount in her heart: pride
and noble ambition were not yet subdued by avarice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Emperor observed that he had still present
in his memory the lessons of pride which he had received
from his mother in his childhood, and which had
influenced his conduct through life. The naturally
powerful mind of Madame Mère had been exalted by
the great events of which she had been a witness; she
had seen five or six revolutions; and her house had been
thrice burnt to the ground by factions in Corsica.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Joseph,” said the Emperor, "rendered me no assistance;
but he is a very good man. His wife, Queen
Julia, is the most amiable creature that ever existed.
Joseph and I were always attached to each other, and
kept on very good terms. He loves me sincerely, and
I doubt not that he would do every thing in the world
to serve me. But his qualities are only suited to private
life. He is of a gentle and kind disposition, possesses
talent and information, and is altogether a very
amiable man. In the discharge of the high duties which
I confided to him, he did the best he could. His intentions
were good; and therefore the principal fault rested
not so much with him as with me, who raised him above
his proper sphere. When placed in important circumstances,
he found his strength unequal to the task imposed
on him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Queen of Naples had chiefly formed herself
amidst great events. She had solid sense, strength of
character, and boundless ambition.... She must
naturally suffer severely from her reverses, more particularly
as she may be said to have been born a Queen.
She had not, like the rest of us,” observed the Emperor,
"moved in the sphere of private life. Caroline, Pauline,
and Jerome, were still in their childhood when I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>attained supreme rank in France; thus they never knew
any other state than that which they enjoyed during the
period of my power.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jerome was an absolute prodigal. He plunged into
boundless extravagance, and the most odious libertinism.
His excuse perhaps may be his youth, and the temptations
by which he was surrounded. On my return from
the Isle of Elba, he appeared to be much improved, and
to afford great promise. One remarkable testimony in
his favour was the love with which he had inspired his
wife, whose conduct was admirable, when, after my fall,
her father, the despotic and harsh King of Wurtemberg,
wished to procure her divorce. The Princess then, with
her own hands, honourably inscribed her name in
history.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To our great regret, dinner was announced; but the
Emperor continued to be very talkative during the whole
of the evening. He took a familiar retrospect of various
subjects, principally alluding to the conduct of many
persons of note during his absence and at the time of
his return. He did not retire until midnight, and he
closed the evening’s conversation with the following
words:—"What is doing at this moment in France and
in Paris? and what shall we ourselves be doing on this
day twelvemonth!"</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE EMPEROR SLEEPING.—MORAL REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>20th.—Mr. Balcombe had intimated to me that he
was appointed to supply us with what we wanted at the
expense of the English Government; but I wrote to
inform him that, as my own pecuniary circumstances
enabled me to dispense with this favour, I was resolved
not to avail myself of it. I therefore begged that he
would obtain permission from the Governor, to receive
from me a bill drawn on some person in England, which
could not be transmitted without special permission. I
wished to remain free from all obligations, so that nothing
might impede me in freely exercising the just and
sad privilege of venting my reproaches and imprecations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor rode out in the calash very early. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>his return, about three o’clock, he desired me to follow
him to his chamber. “I am low-spirited, unwell, and
fatigued,” said he, “sit down in that arm-chair, and
bear me company.” He then threw himself on his
couch and fell asleep, while I watched beside him. I
sat within a few paces of him. His head was uncovered,
and I gazed on his brow,—that brow on which were
inscribed Marengo, Austerlitz, and a hundred other
immortal victories. What were my thoughts and sensations
at that moment? They may be imagined; but I
cannot attempt to describe them!</p>

<p class='c001'>In about three quarters of an hour, the Emperor
awoke. He took a few turns in his chamber, and he
then took a fancy to visit the apartments of all the individuals
of his suite. When he had minutely considered
all the inconveniences of mine, he said with a smile of
indignation:—"Well, I do not think that any christian
on earth can be worse lodged than you are."</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor attempted to read a part
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Caravansêrail de Sarrazin</cite></span>. After glancing over
a few of the tales, and reading a page from one of them,
he said:—"The moral of this story doubtless is that
men never change. This is not true; they change both
for better and worse. A thousand other maxims which
authors attempt to establish are all equally false. They
affirm that men are ungrateful; but no, they are not so
ungrateful as is supposed: and if ingratitude be frequently
a subject of complaint, it is because the benefactor
requires more than he gives.</p>

<p class='c001'>"It is also said that when you know a man’s character,
you have a key to his whole conduct. This is a
mistaken notion. A man may commit a bad action,
though he be fundamentally good; he may be led into
an act of wickedness, without being himself wicked.
This is because man is usually actuated not by the natural
bent of his character, but by a secret momentary
passion, which has lain dormant and concealed in the
inmost recesses of his heart. Another error is to suppose
that the face is the mirror of the mind. The truth
is that it is very difficult to know a man’s character.
To avoid being deceived on this point, it is necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to judge a person by his actions only; and it must
be by his actions of the moment, and merely for that
moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In truth, men have their virtues and their vices,
their heroism and their perversity; men are neither
generally good nor generally bad; but they possess and
practise all that is good and bad in this world. This is
the principle: natural disposition, education and accidental
circumstances produce the applications. I have
always been guided by this opinion, and I have generally
found it correct. However, I was deceived in 1814,
when I believed that France, at the sight of her dangers,
would make common cause with me; but I was not
deceived in 1815, on my return from Waterloo.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor felt unwell, and retired very early.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE GOVERNOR ARRESTS ONE OF OUR SERVANTS.—THE<br /> BIBLE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>21st.—The Emperor continued indisposed; we nevertheless
took our usual airing in the calash. On our
return, we were informed that the Governor had been to
Longwood and had himself arrested one of our domestics,
who had recently quitted the service of Deputy-Governor
Skelton, and who had a few days since been engaged by
General Montholon. On hearing this, the Emperor
exclaimed: “What turpitude! what meanness! A
Governor ... an English Lieutenant-General
himself to arrest a servant! Really this conduct is too
disgusting!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Grand Marshal joined us, and announced the
arrival of a store ship, which had left England on the
8th of March.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor asked what we would read,
and we all decided for the Bible. “This is certainly
very edifying,” said the Emperor; “it would never be
guessed in Europe.” He read to us the book of Joshua,
observing at almost every town or village that he named:
“I encamped there; I carried that place by assault; I
gave battle here, &amp;c.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>INSTANCES OF THE CAPRICE OF AUTHORITY—PRINCESS<br /> STEPHANIE OF BADEN, &amp;C.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>22nd.—In the course of this day a great deal was said
about the sailors of the Northumberland, who had been
given to us as domestics, and who, we now understood,
were to be withdrawn from our service. They had,
however, been engaged by a reciprocal contract, by which
both parties were bound for the space of a year. But
we are without the pale of ordinary law. The Governor
affirmed that the Admiral wanted the men; and the Admiral
said that he would allow them to remain with us
if the Governor pleased. The sailors were taken away,
and soldiers were sent in their stead; but these were
also removed and sent back again, ordered away a second
time and again sent back to us. We were unable to
guess the meaning of all these changes.</p>

<p class='c001'>While I was in the Emperor’s apartment, waiting for
the announcement of dinner, the conversation fell on
Madame Campan’s establishment, the young persons
who had been educated in it, and the fortunes which the
Emperor had conferred on some of them. He particularly
alluded to Stephanie de Beauharnais, afterwards
Princess of Baden, to whom he said he was much attached.
He entered into many details respecting her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Princess Stephanie of Baden lost her mother in her
childhood. She was left in the care of an English lady,
her mother’s intimate friend, who was very rich and without
children, and who confided the education of her
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>protegée</em></span> to some old nuns in the south of France, I believe
at Montauban.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon, during his Consulship, one day heard Josephine
mention this circumstance, while alluding to her
young relation Stephanie. “How can you permit this?”
said he. “How can you suffer one of your name to be
supported by a foreigner, an Englishwoman, who must
at this moment be regarded as our enemy? Are you not
afraid that your memory will one day suffer for this?” A
courier, was immediately despatched to bring the young
lady to the Tuileries; but the nuns refused to part with
her. Napoleon, however, instituted the necessary legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>forms, and a second courier was speedily sent to the Prefect
of the district, with orders instantly to seize the
person of the young lady in the name of the law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the circumstances of the times, such was
the influence of certain systems of education, and of the
opinions which they inspired, that Stephanie’s removal
was to herself a source of deep regret; and she beheld
not without terror him who declared himself her relative,
and who was about to become her benefactor. She was
placed in the establishment of Madame Campan, at St.
Germain; all sorts of masters were appointed to superintend
her education, and, on her introduction to the
world, her beauty, wit, accomplishments, and virtues,
rendered her an object of universal admiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor adopted her as his daughter, and gave
her in marriage to the hereditary Prince of Baden. This
union was for several years far from being happy. In
course of time, however, the causes of difference gradually
vanished; the Prince and Princess became attached to each
other, and from that moment they had only to regret the
happiness of which they had deprived themselves during
the early years of their marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the conferences of Erfurt, the Princess of Baden
received the most marked attentions from her brother-in-law,
the Emperor Alexander. During our disasters, in
1813, persons who were at the head of political affairs,
dreading the result of an interview between Alexander
and the Princess of Baden, at Manheim, succeeded in
depriving the Princess of the regard of her august relative,
by circulating false reports to the prejudice of her
character. When therefore Alexander arrived at Manheim,
on his triumphal march to Paris, he by no means
treated Princess Stephanie with due respect. His conduct
was calculated to wound her feelings; but it could not
humble her pride. On this occasion, the conduct pursued
by the Prince of Baden reflected true glory on his
character. The most august personages surrounded him,
and urged him to repudiate the wife whom he had received
from the hands of Napoleon. But the Prince,
with true nobleness of sentiment, rejected the idea, observing
that he would never commit an act of baseness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>which would be as repugnant to his affections as to his
honour. This generous Prince, to whom we did not
render sufficient justice in Paris, afterwards fell a victim
to a tedious and painful illness. The Princess personally
attended her husband throughout the whole of his sufferings,
performing with her own hands all the minute services
that his situation required: her devoted attachment
gained for her the admiration of her relatives and subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Princess Stephanie of Baden shed a lustre over her exalted
station. She conferred honour on her character as
a wife and a daughter. She at all times professed the
highest veneration for him, who, when in the enjoyment
of boundless power, had benevolently adopted her as his
child.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE EMPEROR’S MAXIMS WITH RESPECT TO SOVEREIGNTY.—THE EXPULSION OF PORTALIS FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATE.—ACCIDENTS WHICH OCCURRED TO THE EMPEROR AT ST. CLOUD, AUXONNE, AND MARLY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>23rd.—The Emperor desired me to attend him in his
chamber, about two o’clock. He remarked that I did
not look well. He was himself ill, and had had but little
sleep during the preceding night. He began to dress,
saying that he should probably feel better when he had
finished his toilet. We then went out to walk in the
garden. The turn of the conversation led the Emperor
to remark that our manners required that a sovereign
should be regarded only as a blessing to his people; his
acts of severity must be overlooked in consideration of
his acts of clemency; mercy must still be held to be his
chief attribute. In Paris, he observed, he had sometimes
been reproached for conversations and words which, in
truth, ought not to have escaped him. But he added
that his personal situation, his extreme activity, and
most of his acts, which really proceeded from himself,
ought to have made amends for many things. He
rendered justice to the delicate tact which distinguished
the inhabitants of the French capital; no where, he
said, could be found so much wit or more taste. He
reproached himself for the expulsion of Portalis from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Council of State. I, who was present at the scene, told
him that I thought his manner was somewhat paternal.
“I was perhaps too severe,” resumed he; “I should
have checked myself before I ordered him to be gone.
He attempted no justification, and therefore the scene
should have ended, merely by my saying <em>It is well</em>. His
punishment should have awaited him at home. Anger is
always unbecoming in a sovereign. But perhaps I was
excusable in my council, where I might consider myself
in the bosom of my own family; or perhaps, after all, I
may be justly condemned for this act. Every one has
his fault; nature will exert her sway over us all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He said he also reproached himself for his conduct to
M. de G—— at the Tuileries, during one of the
grand Sunday audiences, and in presence of all the
Court.—"But in this instance," said he, <a id='corr199.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='I'>“I</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_199.16'><ins class='correction' title='I'>“I</ins></a></span> was provoked
to the utmost extreme. My anger burst forth against
my inclination. I had given G—— the command
of a legion of the capital, which I was about to defend.
I afterwards learned that he rejoiced in our disasters,
and invoked them, though I did not know this at the
period to which I am now alluding. The enemy was
advancing upon us, and G—— coolly wrote to inform
me that his health would not permit him to take the
command; though, as a courtier, he presented himself
to me in perfect activity and good spirits. I was very
indignant at his conduct; but I repressed my anger, and
resolved to take no notice of him. He, however, on
three or four occasions sought an opportunity of throwing
himself in my way. I could no longer stifle my rage,
and the bomb exploded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” concluded the Emperor, "what distressed me
most of all, was the situation of G....’s son,
who was my chamberlain, and of whom I had no reason
to complain."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then spoke of the Faubourg St. Germain,
and questioned me respecting many families and
individuals belonging to it. He happened to mention the
name of Madame de S....; I observed that she had
constantly evinced great attachment to the Emperor, for
which she was now doubtless severely punished. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Emperor was not aware of the extent and sincerity of
her zeal and devotedness; though he had been very much
moved by her generous resolution of remaining with the
Empress Josephine. He had, he said, to reproach himself
for not having done any thing for Madame de S.....
She must have been unfortunate in the choice of the
moment at which she solicited her husband’s nomination
to the Senate.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had, from my childhood, been intimately acquainted
with Madame de S....; and she made me her
confidential friend. I related to the Emperor the anecdote
of her nomination to the post of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>dame du palais</em></span>.
Her husband one morning introduced her to the Empress
Josephine, who returned her thanks for having made an
application to enter her service. This was a thunderbolt
to Madame de S...., who had never dreamed of
making such a solicitation; and who, in the natural timidity
of her disposition, preserved silence. At that time
I was certainly far from approving or advising her acceptance
of the post: I nevertheless rendered her a real act
of service by withholding a letter of refusal which she
had confided to me, without the knowledge of her friends,
and which might have proved fatal to the intrigues of
those by whom the affair had been brought about.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor asked me what could have given rise to
this repugnance on the part of Madame de S.... to
enter the service of the Empress? I replied that it was
occasioned by the connection she had had with the royal
family. “She was right,” said he, "how could her
husband think of placing her in a situation so hostile
to her feelings? A similar case occurred in one of my
nominations of Chamberlains. One individual begged
that I would be pleased to allow him to decline the honour,
because, as he said, he had been first Gentleman
of the Chamber to Louis XVI. and Louis XVIII. This
was perfectly reasonable on his part; but how could I
possibly listen to such a solicitation? It was a proof of
want of delicacy in those who proposed his nomination;
but what had I to do with that? Could I enter into details
of this kind? The important affairs that claimed my
attention would not permit me to descend to matters of
this sort.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“However,” continued the Emperor, "if Madame de
S.... had gone the right way to work, she might
have obtained all she asked for. But she never evinced
any particular interest in what she solicited, and made
applications only in favour of individuals who had not
proved themselves very deserving; among others she
recommended to my notice a man who, after being one
of the King’s Peers, wished to be made one of mine. On
my return from Elba, his daughter came to assure me
that, if I would confer this favour upon him, he would
pledge himself to act with zeal in my service, acknowledging,
as he said, no interests but those of the nation.
All this was of course fair enough."</p>

<p class='c001'>About four o’clock the Emperor got into the calash;
during our usual ride, he mentioned several serious accidents
by which, at one time or other, his life had been
endangered.</p>

<p class='c001'>At St. Cloud, he once attempted to drive his calash
six-in-hand. The horses were startled by Aide-de-camp
Cafarelli inadvertently crossing the road in front of them.
Before the Emperor had time to recover the reins, the
horses set off at full speed, and the calash, which rolled
along with extreme velocity, struck against a railing. The
Emperor was thrown out to the distance of eight or ten
feet, and lay stretched on the ground upon his face. He
was, he said, dead for a few seconds. He felt the moment
at which life became extinct, which he called the
<em>negative moment</em>. The first person who touched him, on
alighting from his horse, immediately revived him. He
observed that the mere contact suddenly called him to
life, as, in the night-mare, the sufferer is relieved as soon
as he can cry out.</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion the Emperor said he had nearly
been drowned. When in garrison at Auxonne, in 1786,
while he was one day amusing himself with swimming,
a sudden numbness came over him; he lost his self-possession,
and, being alone, he was carried along by the
current in a senseless state. He felt life escape him, and
even heard his comrades on the shore call out that he
was drowned, and hasten in quest of boats to recover
his body. In this case a sudden shock restored him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>life. His breast struck against a sand-bank; and, by a
miracle, his head, being above the water, he recovered
himself sufficiently to swim ashore. The water was discharged
from his stomach; he regained the spot where
he had left his clothes, and, having dressed himself, he
got home, while his friends were still in search of his
body.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another time, while hunting the wild boar at Marly,
all his suite was put to flight; it was like the rout of an
army. The Emperor, with Soult and Berthier, maintained
their ground against three enormous boars. “We
killed all three; but I received a hurt from my adversary,
and nearly lost this finger,” said the Emperor,
pointing to the third finger of his left hand, which indeed
bore the mark of a severe wound. "But the most
laughable circumstance of all was to see the multitude
of men, surrounded by their dogs, screening themselves
behind the three heroes, and calling out lustily:—‘<em>Save
the Emperor! Save the Emperor!</em>’ while not one advanced
to my assistance."</p>

<h3 class='c006'>POLITICAL REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>24th.—The Emperor went out only to take an airing
in the calash. We drove for nearly an hour and a half,
proceeding at a slow pace, and lengthened our airing by
going twice over the limits of our usual ride. The Emperor
conversed on politics. The newspapers, which we
had received three days ago, furnished the subject of
discussion.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, he observed, the patriots were emigrating
rapidly; and there seemed to be a wish to encourage
their emigration, from the circumstance of their property
not having been confiscated, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor thought he could perceive from the debates
in the English Parliament, that there was a reserved
idea respecting the partition of France; this was
a severe shock to his feelings. “Every one possessing
a true French heart,” said he, “must now be overwhelmed
with despair. An immense majority of the
population of France must be plunged in the deepest
sorrow. Ah!” he exclaimed, “why am I not placed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>some remote sphere, on a soil truly free and independent,
where no external influence could be dreaded! how
would I astonish the universe! I would address a proclamation
to the French; I would say to them;—You
are lost if you are not united. The odious, the insolent
foreigner is about to parcel you out and to annihilate
you. Frenchmen arise; make common cause, at all
hazards,—rally, if it must be so, even around the Bourbons!
Let the existence, the safety of France, take place
of every other consideration!...”</p>

<p class='c001'>He thought, however, that Russia must oppose this
division, as she would thereby have to fear the growing
strength and consolidation of Germany against her.
Some one present remarked that Austria must oppose it
also, from the apprehension of wanting the necessary
support in case of any attempts on the part of Russia.
It was moreover observed that, in such a case, Austria
might probably serve the cause of the King of Rome, by
putting him forward. “Yes,” replied the Emperor, "as
an instrument of menace, perhaps; but never as the object
of her good wishes. Austria must have too much
cause to dread him. The King of Rome will be the man
of the people; he will be the champion of Italy. Thus
it will be the policy of Austria to take his life. This will
not probably be attempted during the reign of his grandfather,
who is a good man;—but the Emperor Francis
cannot live for ever. If, however, the manners of the
present age should preclude the possibility of an attempt
to murder him, they will endeavour to brutalize his faculties.
Or finally, if he should escape both physical
and moral assassination,—if his mother’s cares and his
own natural endowments should rescue him from all
those dangers, then—then—" (he repeated several times,
as if absorbed in reflection) “why then—But who can
calculate on the destinies of any one here below!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then turned the conversation to England,
by remarking that she alone was interested in the destruction
of France; and in the plenitude and versatility
of his fancy, he touched on all the various plans which
she was likely to adopt for that purpose. She could
not increase the power of Belgium, he said, otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Antwerp would become as formidable to her as it had
been under his reign. She must, he observed, leave the
Bourbons in the centre, with only eight or ten millions
of inhabitants, and surround them with Princes, Dukes,
or Kings of Normandy, Brittany, Aquitaine, and Provence;
so that Cherbourg, Brest, the Garonne, and the
Mediterranean would be in the possession of different
sovereigns. This, he said, would make the French monarchy
retrograde several ages, would restore it to its
situation under the first Capets, and would provide for
the Bourbons a few centuries of new and laborious efforts.—"But,
fortunately," observed the Emperor, "before
England can arrive at this point, she will have to
surmount almost invincible obstacles,—the uniformity of
the division of the territory into departments, the similitude
of language, the identity of manners, the universality
of the code, the generality of my lyceums, and
the glory and splendour which I have left behind me;
these are so many indissoluble knots and truly national
institutions.</p>

<p class='c001'>"A great nation like France cannot easily be parcelled
out, or, if it should, it will be constantly re-uniting and
seeking to recover its importance; like Ariosto’s giant,
who runs after his limbs and even his head, as they are
lopped off, and after putting them on begins to fight
again." “But Sire,” said some one present, “the power
of the giant depended on the plucking out of a single
hair; and, in like manner, Napoleon may be said to
be the hair on which depended the existence of France.”
“No,” resumed the Emperor, “my memory and my
ideas would still survive.—But,” continued he, “England,
on the contrary, would in course of time have
become a mere appendage to France, had the latter
continued under my dominion. England was by nature
intended to be one of our Islands, as well as Oleron or
Corsica. On what trifles does the fate of Empires depend!
How petty and insignificant are our revolutions in
the grand organization of the universe! If, instead of
entering upon the Egyptian expedition, I had invaded
Ireland; if some slight derangement of my plans had
not thrown obstacles in the way of my Boulogne enterprise;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>what would England have been to-day? What
would have been the situation of the continent and of
the whole political world?”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>VOLTAIRE’S BRUTUS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>25th.—After dinner the Emperor read Œdipus, which
he admired exceedingly. He next took up Brutus, of
which he gave us a very remarkable analysis. He observed
that Voltaire seemed not to have entered into the
right feeling for his subject. “The Romans,” said he,
“were guided by patriotism, as we are by honour. Voltaire
has not portrayed the real sublimity of Brutus,
sacrificing his sons for the welfare of his country, and in
spite of the pangs of paternal affection. He has made
him a monster of pride, decreeing the death of his children
for the sake of preserving his power, his name, and
his celebrity. The other characters of the tragedy, he
added, are equally misconceived. Tullia is described
as a fury who takes advantage of her situation; and not
as a woman of tender sentiment, who might be led into
crime by seduction and dangerous influence.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FRENCH COLONY ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE.—THE EMPEROR MIGHT HAVE PROCEEDED TO AMERICA.—CARNOT AT THE TIME OF THE ABDICATION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>26th.—The Emperor sent for me about two o’clock.
He was not well and was much fatigued. We looked
over a few newspapers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these papers it was stated that Joseph Bonaparte
had made extensive purchases of land on the north of the
State of New York, on the river St. Lawrence, and that
a great number of French families had grouped round
him and were soon likely to form a numerous colony. It
was remarked that the spot seemed to have been fixed
on with a view to the interests of the United States, and
in opposition to the policy of England. In the south,
in Louisiana, for example, the refugees could have looked
forward only to the enjoyment of repose and domestic
happiness; but in their present situation they must soon
become a natural attraction to the population of Canada,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>which was already French, and they must ultimately
form a strong barrier, or even a hostile point against the
English, who yet possess the dominion of that part of
America. The Emperor said that the establishment
would in a few years present a numerous population,
distinguished for all sorts of useful knowledge. If they
do their duty, said he, they will transmit from their
colony excellent writings, victorious refutations of the
system which now triumphs in Europe. When at the
Island of Elba, the Emperor had entertained a similar
idea.</p>

<p class='c001'>He then proceeded to calculate all that he had given
to the different members of his family; and observed that
they might have amassed considerable sums of money.
For his part, he said, he had nothing; if in the course
of time, he should find himself in possession of any
property in Europe, he should be wholly indebted for
it to the foresight and contrivance of some of his
friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Emperor had gone to America, he intended to
have collected all his relatives around him; and he supposed
that they might have realized at least forty
millions of francs. This point would have become the
nucleus of a national union, a second France. Before the
conclusion of a year, the events of Europe would have
collected around him a hundred millions of francs and
sixty thousand individuals, most of them possessing
wealth, talent, and information. The Emperor said that
he should have liked to realize that dream; it would
have been a renewal of his glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>“America,” continued he, “was in all respects our
proper asylum. It is an immense continent, possessing
the advantages of a peculiar system of freedom. If a
man is troubled with melancholy, he may get into a
coach, and drive a thousand leagues, enjoying all the
way the pleasure of a common traveller. In America
you may be on a footing of equality with every one; you
may, if you please, mingle with the crowd, without
inconvenience, retaining your own manners, your own
language, your own religion, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He said it was impossible that he could henceforth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>consider himself as a private man in Europe; his name
was too popular throughout the continent. He was in
some way or other connected with every people, and
belonged to every country.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for you,” said he to me smiling, “your fate
seemed naturally to lead you to the shores of the Oronooko
or to Mexico, where the recollection of the good
Las Cases is not yet obliterated. You would there have
enjoyed all you could have wished. The destinies of
some men seem to be marked out. Gregoire, for instance,
has only to go to Hayti, and he would immediately
be made a Pope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of the Emperor’s second abdication, an
American in Paris wrote to him as follows:—"While
you were at the head of a nation, you could perform any
miracle, you might conceive any hopes; but now you
can do nothing more in Europe. Fly to the United
States! I know the hearts of the leading men and the
sentiments of the people of America. You will there
find a second country and every source of consolation."
The Emperor would not listen to such a suggestion. He
might, doubtless, by dint of speed or disguise, have
gained Brest, Nantes, Bordeaux, or Toulon, and in all
probability have reached America; but he conceived that
either disguise or flight would be derogatory from his
dignity. He thought himself bound to prove to all
Europe his full confidence in the French people, and
their extreme attachment to him, by passing through his
dominions at such a crisis, merely in the quality of a
private man, and unattended by any escort. But what
above all influenced him at that critical moment was
the hope that impending dangers would open the eyes of
his subjects, that they would rally around him, and that
he might save the country. This hope caused him to
linger at Malmaison, and to postpone his departure, after
he had reached Rochefort. If he is now at St. Helena,
he owes his captivity to this sentiment, of which he was
unable to divest himself. Subsequently, when he had no
other resource than to accept the hospitality of the
Bellerophon, it was not perhaps without a feeling of
inward satisfaction that he found himself, by the force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of circumstances, irresistibly led to fix his abode in England,
where he might enjoy the happiness of being still
but little removed from France. He was well aware
that he could not be free in England; but he hoped to
be heard, and then a chance would at least have been
open to the impressions which he might create. “The
English Ministers,” said he, “who are the enemies of
their country, and who have sold her to foreigners,
thought they had too much cause to dread my presence.
They conceived that my opinion in London would be
more powerful than the whole Opposition: that it would
have compelled them either to change their system or
resign their places; and, to keep themselves in place,
they basely sacrificed the true interests of their country,
the triumph, the glory of her laws, the peace of the
world, the welfare of Europe, the happiness and the
benedictions of posterity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of conversation during the evening, the
Emperor once more adverted to Waterloo, and described
his anxiety and indecision before he came to a final
resolution respecting his abdication. I pass over a
multitude of details, lest I should be led into repetition;
I note down only the following:—</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor’s speech to his ministers was the literal
prophecy of all that subsequently took place. Carnot
was the only one who seemed to take a right view of the
case. He opposed the abdication, which he said was a
death-blow to France; and he wished that we should
defend ourselves even to annihilation. Carnot was the
only one who maintained this opinion; all the rest were
for the abdication. That measure was determined,
and Carnot, covering his face with his hands, burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>At another moment the Emperor said, “I am not a
God: I cannot do all by my own single efforts: I cannot
save the nation without the help of the nation. I am
certain that the people then entertained these sentiments,
and that they are now suffering undeservedly. It was
the host of intriguers, and men possessing titles and
offices, who were really guilty. That which misled them,
and which ruined me, was the mild system of 1814, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>benignity of the restoration; they looked for a repetition
of this lenity. The change of the Sovereign had become
a mere joke. They all calculated on remaining just as
they had been before, whether I should be succeeded by
Louis XVIII. or any other. These stupid, selfish, and
egotistical men looked upon the great event as merely a
competition, about which they cared but little; and they
thought only of their individual interests, when a deadly
war of principles was about to be commenced. And why
should I disguise the truth? There were among the
individuals whom I had elevated, and by whom I was
surrounded, a number of proud ...!”
Then, turning to me, he added, “I am not alluding to
your Faubourg St. Germain, with respect to which the
matter was totally different, and for which some excuse
may be found. During my first reverses in 1814, the
greatest traitors were not the persons connected with
that party, of whom I had no great cause to complain;
and, who, therefore, on my return, were not bound to
me by any particular ties of gratitude. I had abdicated,
the King was restored. They had but returned to their
old attachments, and had only renewed their allegiance.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>STATE OF FRENCH MANUFACTURES.—ON PHYSIOGNOMY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>27th.—The Emperor went out about 2 o’clock; the
weather was very fine. The season is sensibly different
from that which we had on our arrival; the air is infinitely
more pure. The Emperor was, however, very
ill, and very low-spirited. He walked to the extremity
of the wood, while we were waiting for the calash. We
took our usual drive.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation turned on the state of manufactures
in France. The Emperor said he had raised them to a
degree of prosperity hitherto unknown; and which was
scarcely credited in Europe, or even in France. This
was a subject of wonder to foreigners on their arrival.
The Abbé de Montesquiou, he said, was constantly expressing
his astonishment at this circumstance, the
proofs of which he had in his own hands, when he
became Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The Emperor was the first individual in France who
said: Agriculture, first; industry, that is to say, manufactures,
next; and, finally, trade, which must arise out
of the superabundance of the two first. He also defined
and put into practice, in a clear and connected way, the
systems most conducive to the interests of our manufacturers
and merchants. To him we were indebted for
the cultivation of sugar, indigo, and cotton. He offered
a reward of a million francs to the person who should
discover a method of spinning flax like cotton; and he
doubted not that this discovery would have been made.
The fatality of circumstances alone prevented this grand
idea from being carried into execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The old aristocracy, those enemies to our prosperity,”
said the Emperor, “exhausted all their wit in
stupid jokes and frivolous caricatures on these subjects.
But the English had no cause to laugh; they felt the
blow, and have not yet recovered from it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A short time before dinner, the Emperor sent for me
to attend him in his chamber. He was very unwell; he
tried to converse, but he had not strength. He attributed
his indisposition to his having drunk some bad
wine, which had newly arrived. He said that Corvisart,
Bertholet, and other physicians and chemists, had frequently
said that if he experienced the least unpleasant
flavour, on first tasting his wine, he must by no means
swallow it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The turn of the conversation led him to express his
surprise at the contrast between the character of the
mind and the expression of the countenance, which was
observable in some individuals. “This proves,” said he,
"that we must not judge of a man by his face; we can
know him only by his conduct. What countenances
have I had to judge of in the course of my life! What
odd samples of physiognomy have come under my observation!
And what rash opinions have I heard on this
subject! Thus I invariably made it a rule never to be
influenced either by features or by words. Still, however,
it must be confessed that we sometimes find curious
resemblances between the countenance and the
character. For instance, on looking at the face of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Monseigneur</em></span> (meaning the Governor), who would not
recognise the features of a tiger-cat! I will mention
another instance. There was a man in my service, who
was employed about my person. I liked him very much;
but I was obliged to dismiss him because I several
times caught him with his hands in my pockets. He
committed his thefts too impudently: let any one look
at this man, and they must admit that he has a magpie’s
eye."</p>

<p class='c001'>While we were conversing on the subject of physiognomy,
some one remarked, that Mirabeau, speaking of
Pastoret’s face, said: “it is a compound of the tiger and
the calf; but the calf predominates.” At this the Emperor
laughed heartily, and said it was strictly true.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor wished to dine alone in his chamber.
He sent for me about ten o’clock. He was then better;
and he looked over several of the books which lay scattered
upon his couch. He began to read Racine’s
Alexander, of which he expressed his dislike; and he
afterwards took up Andromache, which is one of his
favourite pieces.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MARKS OF RESPECT SHEWN TO THE EMPEROR BY THE<br /> ENGLISH SOLDIERS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>28th.—The Emperor went out about two o’clock.
The weather was exceedingly pleasant. We took nearly
an hour’s drive in the calash. It had been at first proposed
that the Emperor should ride on horseback; for
his health was suffering from the want of that exercise.
But he would not consent to go out on horseback; he
said that to ride backward and forward within the limits
marked out for him was like being confined in a riding-school,
and he could not endure it. However, on our
return home, we succeeded in changing his determination.
We all attended him, and we reached the summit
of that part of Goat Hill which separates the horizon of
the town from that of Longwood. On our way back,
we passed in front of the English camp; this was the
first time we had passed it since our residence at Longwood.
The soldiers immediately quitted their various
occupations, and eagerly formed themselves in a line as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>we passed along. “What European soldier,” said the
Emperor, “would not be inspired with respect at my
approach!” He knew this, and therefore carefully
avoided passing the English camp, lest he should be
accused of wishing to excite this sentiment. We all very
much enjoyed the ride, and returned home about five
o’clock. The Emperor was a little fatigued.</p>

<p class='c001'>For some time past, he has relinquished his regular
dictations. He saw some skittles which had been made
by the servants for their own amusement. He ordered
them to be brought to us, and we played several games
with them. The Emperor won a napoleon and a half
from me. He made me pay the debt, and then threw
the money to the servant who had attended us for the
purpose of running after the ball.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CORSICA.—REMARK MADE BY PAOLI.—MAGNANIMOUS CONDUCT OF MADAME MÉRE.—LUCIEN INTENDED TO BE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF CORSICA.—THE FIRST CONSUL’S COURT.—MADAME DE CHEVREUSE.—THE EMPEROR RECEIVES A LETTER FROM HIS MOTHER.</h3>

<p class='c007'>29th.—For some time past, at our urgent solicitation,
the Emperor every evening made a promise that he
would ride on horseback early on the following morning;
but whenever the appointed hour arrived he invariably
changed his determination. This morning, he was in
the garden by half-past eight o’clock, and he sent for
me. The conversation turned on Corsica, and was
maintained for upwards of an hour.</p>

<p class='c001'>"One’s native country," said he, “is always dear.
Even St. Helena may have charms to those who were
born here.” To the Emperor, therefore, Corsica presented
a thousand attractions. He described the grand
scenery of the country, and remarked that islanders
always display originality of character, because their situation
tends to protect them against invasion, and precludes
that perpetual intercourse with foreigners which
is experienced in continental states. The inhabitants
of mountainous regions, he said, always possess a degree
of energy, and a turn of mind peculiar to themselves.
He dwelt much on the charms of his native country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>which, from his early recollections, was to him superior
to any other spot in the world. He thought that the
very smell of the earth would enable him to distinguish
his native land, even were he conducted blindfold to her
shores; there was in it something peculiar, which he
had never perceived elsewhere. Corsica was the scene
of all his early attachments; he had there passed the
happy years of his childhood, freely roaming among the
hills and valleys, enjoying the honours and pleasures of
hospitality. He traced different lines of family connections,
who, he said, extended the spirit of animosity and
revenge, even to the seventh degree; and he observed
that a young woman in Corsica thought she enhanced
the value of her dowry by enumerating the list of her
cousins. He recollected with pride that, when only
twenty years of age, he had accompanied Paoli on a
grand excursion to Porte di Nuovo. Paoli’s retinue was
numerous; he was escorted by upwards of 500 of his
followers on horseback. Napoleon rode by his side, and,
as they went along, Paoli pointed out to him the different
positions and the places which had been the scenes
of resistance or triumph during the war for Corsican
liberty. He related to him all the particulars of that
glorious conflict; and, on hearing the remarks and
opinions which fell from his young companion, he said,
"Oh Napoleon! there is nothing modern in your character!
you are formed entirely on Plutarch’s model."</p>

<p class='c001'>When Paoli manifested his determination to surrender
the island to the English, the Bonaparte family continued
to head the French party, and had the fatal honour
of being the object of <em>a march</em> of the inhabitants of the
island, that is to say, they were attacked by a levy in
mass: 12 or 15,000 peasants made a descent from the
mountains on Ajaccio. The house occupied by Napoleon’s
family was pillaged and burnt, and the vines and
flocks were destroyed. Madame, surrounded by a few
faithful friends, wandered for some time on the sea-shore,
and was at length obliged to fly to France. The
Bonaparte family had always been much attached to
Paoli, and he in his turn had professed particular respect
towards Madame. It is, however, but just to remark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>that he employed persuasion before he resorted to force.
“Renounce this opposition,” said he, “it will prove the
ruin of yourself, your family, and your fortune; you
will bring irreparable misery on yourself.” The Emperor,
indeed, affirmed that, but for the chance of the
revolution, the family could never have recovered from
their misfortunes. Madame, like another Cornelia,
heroically replied, “that she, her children, and her relatives
would only obey two laws, namely, those of duty
and honour. Had old Archdeacon Lucien been living at
that time, his heart would have bled at the idea of the
danger of his sheep, goats, and cattle, and his prudence
would not have failed to allay the storm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Madame Bonaparte, the victim of her patriotism and
her attachment to France, expected to be received at
Marseilles as an emigrant of distinction; but there she
scarcely found herself in safety; and, to her astonishment,
discovered that the spirit of patriotism existed only
among the very lowest classes of the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon, in his youth wrote a history of Corsica,
which he dedicated to the Abbé Raynal. This production
gained for him some flattering compliments and letters
from the Abbé, who was the fashionable author of
the day. This history has been lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor remarked that, during the war in Corsica,
all the French who came to the island formed some
decided opinion on the character of the mountaineers.
Some said that they were full of enthusiasm, others
regarded them as mere banditti.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was said in the Senate at Paris, that France had
chosen a ruler from among a people whom the Romans
would not take for their slaves. “The Senator intended
this remark as an insult to me,” said the Emperor; “but
he forgot how high a compliment he was thus paying to
the Corsicans. He spoke truly: the Romans never purchased
Corsican slaves: they knew that it was impossible
to reduce the Corsicans under the yoke of slavery.”</p>

<p class='c001'>During the war for liberty in Corsica, some one proposed
the singular plan of cutting down and burning all
the chesnut-trees, the fruit of which furnishes sustenance
to the mountaineers. By this means it was hoped they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>would be compelled to descend to the plains to sue for
food and peace. Happily, said the Emperor, this was
one of those impracticable plans which can be realized
only on paper. From very different motives, Napoleon,
during the early period of his life, had constantly declaimed
against the goats, which are very numerous in
the island, and commit great ravages among the trees.
He wished them to be entirely extirpated. On this subject
he had some terrible disputes with his uncle, Archdeacon
Lucien, who possessed numerous herds of goats,
and who defended them like a patriarch. In his rage,
he reproached his nephew with being an <em>innovator</em>, and
inveighed against <em>philosophic ideas</em>, as the cause of the
danger with which his goats were threatened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Paoli died in London at a very old age: he lived to
see Napoleon First Consul and Emperor. The Emperor
expressed his regret at not having recalled him.
“That,” said he, “would have been highly gratifying to
me. Such an act would have been a real trophy of honour.
But my mind was absorbed in important affairs;
I rarely had time to indulge my personal feelings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After the Emperor’s return in 1815, when Lucien
arrived in Paris, Joseph advised the Emperor to appoint
him Governor General of Corsica. This measure
was even determined on; the importance and
hurry of passing events alone prevented its execution.
“If Lucien had gone to Corsica,” said the Emperor,
“he would still have remained master of the Island, and
what resources would it not have presented to our persecuted
patriots?—To how many unfortunate families
would not Corsica have afforded an asylum? He repeated
that he had perhaps committed a fault, at the time
of his abdication, in not reserving to himself the sovereignty
of Corsica, together with the possession of some
millions of the civil list; and in not having conveyed all
his valuables to Toulon, whence nothing could have impeded
his passage. In Corsica, he would have found
himself at home; the whole population would have been,
as it were, his own family. He might have disposed of
every arm and every heart. Thirty thousand or even
50,000 allied troops could not have subdued him.” No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>sovereign in Europe would have undertaken such a task.
But it was precisely the happy security of the situation
that deterred him from availing himself of it. He would
not have it said that, amidst the wreck of the French
people, which he plainly foresaw, he alone had been
artful enough to gain the port.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one here observed that, according to the general
opinion, he might, in 1814, have secured the possession
of Corsica instead of the Island of Elba. “Certainly
I might,” replied the Emperor, “and those who
are well acquainted with the affairs of Fontainebleau will
be surprised that I did not. I might then have reserved
to myself whatever I pleased. The humour of the moment
led me to decide in favour of Elba. Had I possessed
Corsica, it is probable that my return in 1815 would
never have been thought of. Even at Elba, those whose
interest it was to keep me there decreed my return by
their own misgovernment and the non-fulfilment of the
engagements which they had entered into with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We now reminded the Emperor of his intention of
riding on horseback; but he said that he would rather
walk and chat. He ordered his breakfast, after which
we conversed for some time on the old Court, the nobility
who composed it, their pretensions, the King’s
equipages, &amp;c.; and all this was compared with what
the Emperor had himself introduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then reverted to the period of his Consulship,
and described the difficulties which he had experienced
in forming the kind of Court which was then
kept up at the Tuileries. On his arrival there, he was
resolved to obliterate the recollection of the manners and
conflicts of the period to which he had just succeeded.
But he had hitherto passed his life in camps: he had
just returned from Egypt, and had quitted France when
young and inexperienced. He was a stranger to every
one, and he at first found this a source of great embarrassment.
Lebrun acted as his guide during the first
years of his Consulship. Bankers and money-speculators
were at that time persons of the first consequence.
No sooner did the Consul enter upon his functions, than
a host of these individuals crowded round him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>eagerly offered to advance him considerable sums of
money. This conduct, though seemingly dictated only
by generosity, was not however without interested views.
They were for the most part men of bad character; and
their offers were rejected. The First Consul had a natural
dislike of men of this profession. He said that he
had taken the firm determination to act upon different
principles from those of Scherer, Barras, and the Directory.
He was anxious that probity should become the
main spring and feature of his new government. The
Consul was also immediately surrounded by the wives of
these money-lenders, who were all beautiful and elegant
women. Indeed a money-lender at that time seemed to
regard it as indispensably necessary that his wife should
be a woman of fascinating manners: it was a circumstance
that tended materially to assist his speculations.
But the prudent Lebrun was at hand to direct the young
Telemachus. He resolved to exclude this sort of society
from the Tuileries. It was, however, no such easy matter
to assemble a suitable circle around the Consul:
nobles were rejected, in order to avoid giving offence to
public opinion; and contractors were excluded, with the
view of purifying the morals of the new era. These two
classes being thus shut out, of course no very distinguished
society remained; and the Tuileries for some
time presented a sort of magic-lantern, very varied and
changeable.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Moscow, the Viceroy happened to meet with some
letters written by Princess Dolgoruki, who had been at
Paris at the period here alluded to. This correspondence
gave a very favourable picture of the Tuileries. The
Princess observed that it was not precisely a Court,
nor yet exactly a camp; but something perfectly new in
its kind. She added that the First Consul did not carry
his hat under his arm, nor wear a dress-sword by his
side; but that he was nevertheless a swordsman.
“However,” continued the Emperor, “such is the effect
of evil report that, owing to some such expressions as
these having been misrepresented to me, Princess Dolgoruki
was very unjustly treated. I ordered her, at that
time, to quit France. We thought her hostile to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>principles of our government; but we were, as it may be
seen, mistaken. Madame G...., the mistress of
M. de T...., for he had not yet made her
his wife, greatly contributed to alienate from us the
regard of the Russians.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor observed that, on his return from Elba,
he had experienced far less embarrassment in composing
his Court. “It was, indeed,” said he, “all ready formed,
by the ladies whom I termed <em>my widows</em>. These were
Madame Duroc, the Duchess of Istria, Mesdames Regnier,
Lagrand, and all the other widows of my first generals.
I told the Princesses, who consulted me on the method
of recomposing their Courts, to follow my example.
Nothing was more natural and proper. These ladies,
though still young, were already experienced in the
world; and among them were several beautiful and fascinating
women. Most of them have now lost their fortunes;
some, I have been told, are re-married, and have
changed their names;<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a> so that, of all the wealth and
rank founded by me, no traces will perhaps remain; even
names will disappear. If this should really be the case,
will it not afford ground for saying that, after all, there
must have been a radical error in the selections I made.
But it will be the worse for the parties themselves; they
will by this means only furnish a triumph and a ground
of insolence to the old aristocracy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We again reminded the Emperor of his intended ride
on horseback: we urged him not to neglect it, because
we knew it to be absolutely necessary for his health. But
we could not prevail on him to leave the garden. “We
are very well here,” said he; “we will have some tents
pitched on this spot.” We began to talk about the Faubourg
St. Germain, and the Hotel de Luynes, which the
Emperor termed its metropolis. He described to us the
cause of the banishment of Madame de Chevreuse. He
said, he had frequently threatened to visit her with this
punishment, and for conduct of the most mischievous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>insolent nature. One day, when urged to the utmost
extremity, he addressed her as follows:—"Madam, according
to the feudal notions and doctrines, entertained
by you and your friends, you pretend to be the sovereigns
of your estates! Now, on the same principles, I may
style myself the Sovereign Lord of France. I may claim
Paris as my village, and may banish from it every individual
who is obnoxious to me. I judge you by your
own laws. Begone! and never venture to return!" On
decreeing her exile, the Emperor was firmly resolved
never to be prevailed on to recal her; because, he said,
he had endured much before he had decreed her punishment,
and he found himself compelled to set an example
of severity to spare the necessity of repeating it on others.
This was one of his grand principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>I told the Emperor that I had frequently visited the
Hotel de Luynes, and that I had been well acquainted
with Madame de Chevreuse and her mother-in-law, for
whom I had always entertained a great regard. The
latter had evinced singular and constant affection for her
daughter-in-law, having shared her exile, and accompanied
her in her different journeys from place to place.
When proceeding on my mission to Illyria, I one night
met them both in an inn at the foot of the Simplon. To
be thus able to procure in the desert the most trivial details
relating to Paris and the Court, was to them a source
of unfeigned joy, and a most unexpected instance of good
fortune. They listened to me with no less eagerness
than that evinced by Fouquet on hearing the accounts of
Lauzun. Their banishment from the capital had been
to them an absolute sentence of death; it had overwhelmed
them with despair!</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, I assured the Emperor that, for a considerable
period, I had observed the Hotel de Luynes, if not subdued,
at least calmed and reduced to something less than
indifference; but our unexpected disasters had revived
its former spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to Madame de Chevreuse, who was a handsome,
intelligent, and amiable woman, with a somewhat romantic
turn of mind, she had doubtless been seduced by the
charms of notoriety, or urged on by her numerous flatterers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and admirers, some of whom were very unworthy
of her regard. “I know it,” observed the Emperor;
“she hoped to recommence <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>the Fronde</em></span>; but I was not
a minor Sovereign.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Musquito brig which left England on the 23rd of
March, arrived with files of the Journal des Debats down
to the 5th of March, and London papers to the 21st.
On retiring to his closet, the Emperor desired me to
follow him. He began to peruse the Journal des Debats;
and, meanwhile, a letter was delivered to me from the
Grand Marshal. It had just arrived from Europe, and
was addressed to the Emperor. I handed it to him. He
read it over once and sighed; and, then, having read it a
second time, he tore it, and threw the fragments beneath
the table. This letter was delivered open! The Emperor
then resumed his perusal of the Journals, and, suddenly
stopping, he said, after a few moments’ silence:—"That
letter was from poor Madame: she is well, and wishes to
come to reside with me at St. Helena!" After this he
continued his reading. This, which was the first letter
that the Emperor had received from any individual of his
family, was in the handwriting of Cardinal Fesch. The
Emperor was evidently much hurt by its having been
delivered to him open.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MOREAU, GEORGES, AND PICHEGRU.—DIFFERENCE OF OPINION PRODUCED BY THEIR CONSPIRACY IN THE CAMP OF BOULOGNE AND IN PARIS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>30th.—The Emperor went out about two o’clock, and
we all attended him. He began to converse about the
intelligence contained in the French papers which he had
just received, and alluded to the statues which, it was
stated, were to be erected to the memory of Moreau and
Pichegru. “A statue to Moreau,” said he, “whose conspiracy
in 1803 is now so well proved! Moreau, who, in
1813, died fighting under the Russian standard! A
monument to the memory of Pichegru, who was guilty
of one of the most heinous of crimes! who purposely
suffered himself to be defeated, and who connived with
the enemy in the slaughter of his own troops! And after
all,” continued he, “history is only made up of reports
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>which gain credit by repetition. Because it has been
repeatedly affirmed that these were great men, who
deserved well of their country, they will at length pass
for such, and their adversaries will be despised.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one present remarked that it might have been
thus in the dark ages of ignorance; but that now the
multitude of monuments and public documents, the arts
of printing and engraving, and the general diffusion of
knowledge, must always render truth accessible to those
who wish to come at it; and, as each party has its own
historians, the thinking reader will always be enabled to
form an impartial opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then described at length the affairs of
Moreau, Georges, and Pichegru, to which I have before
alluded, and of which I promised further details. He
now informed us that the man who made the first confessions
indicated, though without naming him, a person
to whom Georges and the other leaders of the conspiracy
never spoke without taking off their hats, and whom
they treated with the utmost consideration and respect.
It was at first supposed that this individual must have
been the Duke de Berri; and some concluded him to
have been the Duke d’Enghien, during his momentary
appearance. Charles d’Hosier, one of the conspirators,
unexpectedly drew aside the veil. A few days after his
arrest, he was seized with a fit of melancholy and hanged
himself in prison. The alarm was however given, and
he was cut down. Stretched on his bed, and while yet
struggling between life and death, he vented repeated
imprecations against Moreau, and accused him of having
treacherously seduced many well-disposed men, and held
out to them promises of assistance which he never realized.
He likewise mentioned the names of Georges
and Pichegru. This was the first circumstance that
excited suspicion against Georges and Pichegru; there
was previously no idea of either the one or the other
having been engaged in the conspiracy. Real, who had
hastened to this sort of death-bed confession of d’Hosier,
proposed to the Consul that he should order the arrest
of Moreau.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This event created a great sensation,” said the Emperor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“The public mind was wrought up to a high
pitch of fermentation. Doubts were entertained of the
truth of the statements made by the Government respecting
the extent of the conspiracy and the number of
the conspirators. Of the latter it was affirmed there
were about forty in Paris. Their names were published,
and the First Consul pledged his honour to secure them.
He summoned Bassières, and gave orders that he, with
his corps, should surround and guard the walls of Paris.
For the space of six weeks, nobody was suffered to quit
the capital without special permission. A general gloom
prevailed through Paris; but every day the Moniteur
announced the arrest of one or two of the individuals
who it was alleged were concerned in the conspiracy.
Public opinion took a turn in my favour; and indignation
against the conspirators increased in proportion as
they were secured. Not one escaped.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The public papers of the period detail the particulars
of the arrest of Georges, who killed two men before he
could be secured. It appears that he was betrayed by
his comrade, who drove the cabriolet in which they were
both riding together.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to Pichegru, he was the victim of the basest treachery.
“This circumstance,” said the Emperor, “was
truly a disgrace to human nature. He was sold by his
intimate friend; by a man whom I will not name, on
account of the horror and disgust which his conduct is
calculated to excite.” We informed the Emperor that
the name of this individual had been mentioned in the
Moniteur, at which he expressed surprise. “This
man,” continued he, "who was formerly a military
officer, and who has since followed the business of a
merchant at Lyons, offered to deliver up Pichegru for
100,000 crowns. On the day on which he made this
proposal, he stated that they had, on the preceding
evening, supped together, and that Pichegru, finding
himself every day alluded to in the Moniteur, and being
aware that the critical moment was fast approaching,
said, ‘If I and a few other Generals were boldly to present
ourselves to the troops, should we not gain them
over?’—‘No,’ replied the friend, ‘you form a wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>idea of the state of feeling in France; you would not
gain over a single soldier.’—He spoke truly. At night,
the faithless friend conducted the officers of the police to
Pichegru’s door; and he gave them a minute description
of his chamber and his means of defending himself.
Pichegru had pistols on his bed-room table, and he kept
a light burning while he slept. The officers gently
unlocked the door by means of false keys, which the
treacherous friend had procured for them. The table
was overturned, the candle was extinguished, and the
officers seized Pichegru, who immediately jumped out of
bed. He was a very powerful man; he struggled desperately,
and it was found necessary to bind him and
convey him to prison, without waiting till he could be
dressed."</p>

<p class='c001'>On being placed at the head of the government, the
First Consul was extremely anxious to tranquillize the
western departments. He summoned nearly all the
leading men of those districts, and succeeded in rousing
several of them to a sense of the interests and glory of
their country; he added that he even drew tears from
the eyes of some. Georges had his turn among the rest.
The Emperor said that he had endeavoured to touch
every individual string of his heart; but in vain, he
could produce no vibration. He found him lost to every
generous feeling, and coldly intent on his own ambitious
calculations. He persisted in his determination to command
his Cantons. The Consul, having exhausted
every conciliatory argument, at length assumed the language
of the first Magistrate of France. He dismissed
him, and recommended him to go home and live quietly
and submissively; and above all, not to mistake the
nature of the course he had that moment adopted, nor
to attribute to weakness what was only the result of his
moderation and the consciousness of his power. He
desired him to repeat to himself, and to all who were
connected with him, that, so long as the First Consul
should hold the reins of authority, there would be no
chance of safety for any who might dare to engage in
conspiracy. Georges took his leave; but, as the event
proved, not without having imbibed from this conference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>a feeling of respect for Napoleon, on whose destruction,
however, he still continued bent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreau was the rallying point and the centre of attraction
to the conspirators, who came from London to
attack Paris. It appeared that Lajollais, his Aide-de-camp,
had deceived these men, by addressing them in
the name of Moreau, and telling them that that General
was secure of popular favour throughout the whole of
France, and could dispose of the whole army. Moreau
constantly assured them that he could command no
one, not even his Aide-de-camp; but that if they killed
the First Consul, they might do any thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreau, when left to himself, was a very good sort
of man. He was easily led, and this accounts for his
inconsistencies. He left the palace in raptures, and returned
to it full of spleen and malice;—having in the
interim seen his mother-in-law and his wife. The First
Consul, who would have been very glad to have gained
him over to his side, once made it up with him completely;
but their friendship lasted only four days. The
Consul then vowed that he would never renew it. In
fact, attempts were afterwards frequently made to reconcile
them; but Napoleon never would agree to it.
He foresaw that Moreau would commit some fault, that
he would lose himself; and certainly he could not have
done so in a way more advantageous to the First Consul.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some days previous to the battle of Leipsic, some
carriages containing property and papers belonging to
Moreau, which were on their way to his widow in England,
were intercepted at Wittemberg. Among those
papers, there was a letter from Madame Moreau herself,
in which she advised her husband to lay aside his
silly wavering conduct, and to come boldly to a determination.
She urged him to assist in the triumph of
the legitimate cause, that of the Bourbons. In answer
to this, Moreau wrote a few days before his death,
begging her not to trouble him with her chimeras. “I
have come near enough to France,” said he, "to learn
all that is going forward there. I have got into a real
hornet’s nest."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was on the point of publishing these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>intercepted papers in the Moniteur; but there still
existed in France some persons blindly tenacious of the
opinion they had always maintained respecting Moreau,
and who persisted in regarding him as a victim of
tyranny. The counter-revolution had not yet afforded
an opportunity of making known those acts hitherto
disavowed, and of claiming their recompense. The circumstance
of personal enmity prevented the Emperor
from executing his intention. He thought that it would
not be becoming to revive this enmity for his own
advantage, and to tarnish the memory of a man who
had just fallen on the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trial of Moreau and Pichegru, which was protracted
for such a length of time, violently agitated the
public mind. What added to the notoriety and interest
of this trial was its connection with the affair of the
Duke d’Enghien, with which it became interwoven. “I
have,” said the Emperor, “been reproached with having
committed a great fault in that trial. It has been compared
with the affair of the necklace, in the reign of
Louis XVI., which that Monarch put into the hands of
Parliament, instead of having it judged by a Commission.
Politicians have affirmed that I should have contented
myself with consigning the criminals to the judgment of
a Military Commission. It would have been ended in
eight and forty hours. I could have done it; it was
legal, and nothing more would have been required of
me; I should have avoided the risks to which I was
exposed. But I felt my power so unlimited, and I was
at the same time so strong in the justice of my cause,
that I was determined the affair should be open to the
observation of the whole world. For this reason the
ambassadors and agents of Foreign powers were present
during the proceedings!”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the company present here observed to the
Emperor that the course he then adopted had proved
advantageous to history and honourable to his own
character. It had furnished three volumes of authentic
documents relating to the trial.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another individual of the Emperor’s suite, who, at
the time of this celebrated trial, was with the army at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Boulogne, said that all these events, even the affair of
the Duke <a id='corr226.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='D’Enghien'>d’Enghien</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_226.2'><ins class='correction' title='D’Enghien'>d’Enghien</ins></a></span>, had there excited but little interest,
and that, on his return to Paris, some time afterwards,
he was astonished to observe the sensation which they
had created in the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor remarked that the public mind had
indeed been highly excited, particularly on the occasion
of the death of the Duke d’Enghien, which event, he
said, still appeared to be judged of in Europe with
blindness and prejudice. He maintained his right of
adopting the step he had taken, and enumerated the
reasons which had urged him to it. He then adverted
to the many attempts that had been made to assassinate
him, and observed that he was bound in justice to say
that he had never detected Louis XVIII. in any direct
conspiracy against his life, though such plots had been
incessantly renewed in other quarters. With regard to
that Prince he had heard only of his systematic plans,
ideal operations, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If,” continued he, “I had continued in France in
1815, I intended to have given publicity to some of the
later attempts that were made against me. The Maubreuil
affair, in particular, should have been solemnly
investigated by the first Court of the Empire, and
Europe would have shuddered to see to what an extent
the crime of secret assassination could be carried.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CONVERSATION RESPECTING THE SITUATION OF ENGLAND.—LETTERS DETAINED BY THE GOVERNOR.—CHARACTERISTIC OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>31st.—At five o’clock, I went to join the Emperor in
the garden; we were all assembled there. The conversation
turned on politics. He described the melancholy
situation of England, amidst her triumphs. He alluded
to the immensity of her debt, the madness, the impossibility
of her becoming a continental power, the dangers
which assailed her constitution, the embarrassment of
her ministers, and the just clamour of the people. England
with her 150 or 200 thousand men, made as many
efforts as he, the Emperor, had ever made during the
period of his great power, and perhaps even more. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>had never employed beyond 500 thousand French troops.
The traces of his Continental system were followed by
all the powers on the Continent, and would be pursued
still further in proportion as those powers became
more settled. He did not hesitate to say, and he
proved it, that England would have gained by adhering
to the treaty of Amiens; that such a line of
conduct would have been to the advantage of all Europe,
but that Napoleon himself, and his glory would have
suffered by it. Yet it was England, and not he, who
broke the treaty.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was only one course, he continued, for England
to pursue; namely, to return to her constitution and
abandon the military system; to interfere with the Continent
only through her maritime influence, in which she
was pre-eminent. It was, he said, easy to foresee that
great calamities would assail her should she adopt any
other course, and this she would inevitably do, because
all her aristocracy urged her to it, and because the folly,
pride, or venality of her present ministry caused her to
persist in the system she was pursuing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation being concluded, the Emperor returned
to his study, and desired me to follow him. He
told me that a letter which had been sent to him from
England by post was said to have been kept back by the
Governor, because it was not addressed to him officially;
and it was said that a letter for the Grand Marshal had
been detained for the same reason. The Emperor observed
that, if this were true, there was something
peculiarly cruel in the conduct of the Governor, in
having sent back the letters without even mentioning
them to us, and without affording us the consolation of
knowing from whom they came.... A neglect of
form, he said, might easily be corrected in the Island;
but it could not so easily be observed at 2000 leagues’
distance. I told the Emperor that a circumstance nearly
similar to that which he had just mentioned had occurred
to me eight or ten days back. “A person who was on
his way to Europe had tormented me with his offers of
service. I yielded to his solicitations, and commissioned
him to order me some shoes and to get a watch changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>for me, for there is no person here who knows how to
repair a watch. The Governor had forbidden the
execution of those commissions, because they had not
been addressed to himself. I have said nothing on the
subject to any one, Sire, because it is a principle with
me to conceal an insult for which I cannot obtain
redress; but I shall find an opportunity to tell the
Governor my mind. In the mean time, neither he nor
the person to whom I gave the commission, has been
able to draw from me a line, or a single word, though
the latter has made several attempts to do so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner the Emperor, conversing on our situation
and the conduct of the Governor, who came to-day
and took a rapid circuit round Longwood, reverted to
the subject of the last interview they had had together,
and made some striking observations respecting it. “I
behaved very ill to him, no doubt,” said he, “and
nothing but my present situation could excuse me; but
I was out of humour, and could not help it; I should
blush for it in any other situation. Had such a scene
taken place at the Tuileries, I should have felt myself
bound in conscience to make some atonement. Never,
during the period of my power, did I speak harshly to
any one without afterwards saying something to make
amends for it. But here I uttered not a syllable of conciliation,
and I had no wish to do so. However, the
Governor proved himself very insensible to my severity;
his delicacy did not seem wounded by it. I should have
liked, for his sake, to have seen him shew a little anger,
or bang the door after him when he went away. This
would at least have shown that there was some spring
and elasticity about him; but I found nothing of the
kind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then again resumed his conversation on
political affairs, which he maintained with so much spirit
and interest, that I could have forgotten for a time
what part of the world I was in. I could have believed
myself still at the Tuileries or in the Rue de Bourgogne.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Saturday, 1st of June.—The Emperor sent for me.
He had just come out of his bath, where he had remained
three hours, and he asked me to guess what
book he had been engaged in reading whilst in the
water; it was Rousseau’s New Eloise. He had expressed
himself quite charmed with this work when he first
perused it at the Briars; but in analysing it again, he
now criticised it with unsparing severity. The rock of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>la Meillerie</em></span> being mentioned, he said he thought it had
been destroyed when he caused a road to be made over
the Simplon; but I assured him that enough remained
to preserve a perfect recollection of it: it projects over
the road, and, like Leucate of old, offers a fine leap to
despairing lovers.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the noble character given by Rousseau to Lord
Edward in his New Eloise, and to the impression produced
by some of Voltaire’s plays, the Emperor ascribed,
in a great measure, the high estimate which had been
formed in France of the English character. The facility
with which public opinion was governed in those days
excited his surprise; Voltaire and Rousseau, who had
<em>then</em> directed it as they pleased, would not, he thought,
be able to do so at the present time; and Voltaire, in
particular, had only exercised so powerful an influence
over his contemporaries, and been considered the great
man of his age, because all around him were pigmies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then proceeded to compare the character
of the English and French nations. “The higher classes
among the English,” said he, "are proud; with us unfortunately
they are only vain; in that consists the great
characteristic distinction between the two nations. The
mass of the people in France certainly possess a greater
share of national feeling than any other now existing in
Europe; they have profited by the experience of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>twenty-five years’ revolution; but unfortunately that class
which the revolution has advanced have not been found
equal to the station of life to which they have been elevated;
they have shown themselves corrupt and unstable:
in the last struggles they have not been distinguished
either by talents, firmness, or virtue; in short, they
have degraded the honour of the nation."</p>

<p class='c001'>A speech of M. de Chateaubriand’s has been read to
the Emperor, on the propriety of allowing the clergy to
inherit. The Emperor observed that it was rather an
Academical oration than the opinion of a legislator—it
had wit, but showed little judgment, and contained no
views whatever.—"Allow the clergy to inherit," said
he, “and nobody will die without being obliged to purchase
absolution: for, whatever our opinions may be, we
none of us know whither we go on leaving this world.
Then must we remember our last and final account, and
no one can pronounce what his feelings will be at his last
hour, nor answer for the strength of his mind at that
awful moment. Who can affirm that I shall not die in
the arms of a confessor? and that he will not make me
acknowledge myself guilty of the evil I shall not have
done, and implore forgiveness for it?”—In the present
instance, however, as somebody has observed, M. de
Chateaubriand may be said to uphold an opinion, rather
than express a sentiment of his own; and there are
strong grounds for believing that, in religion, as well as
in politics, he has often been known to set forth doctrines
which had failed to carry conviction to his own
mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the article of religion, for instance, it is well known
that before he wrote his <cite>Beauties of Christianity</cite>, he had
published in London another work, of a tendency decidedly
anti-religious.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The bookseller to whom he entrusted
the sale of this work, was Dulau, formerly a benedictine
monk of Soreze, who had sought refuge in
London at the time of the revolution. Being a man of
intelligent mind and sound judgment, he took the liberty
of giving M. de Chateaubriand some good advice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>He represented to him that both the place and
the time were ill chosen for indulging in declamations
against religion; that the moment had gone by when
they were favourably received; that they had become
common-place and in bad taste; and that the surest way
to engage the attention of the public would be to take
up the other side of the question, and advocate, on the
contrary, the cause of religion. M. de Chateaubriand
listened to this advice, and wrote his <cite>Beauties of Christianity</cite>;
and the event proved that Dulau had not been
mistaken in his choice of the moment, for it is very
doubtful, if the work were to appear now, whether it
would obtain the brilliant success it then met with, notwithstanding
the great merit which it undoubtedly
possesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The appointment of the author of <cite>The Beauties of
Christianity</cite> to the embassy of Rome, was considered,
at the time, as a very delicate attention on the part of
the First <a id='corr231.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Counsul'>Consul</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_231.19'><ins class='correction' title='Counsul'>Consul</ins></a></span> to M. de Chateaubriand, who, in his
turn, hailed it as a first triumph, and the presage of still
greater triumphs which awaited him in the capital of
the Christian world, amongst the rulers of the church.
But he was soon doomed to find himself greatly mistaken,
for people at Rome were highly scandalized at seeing
religion transformed into romance, and the Divines condemned
without hesitation <cite>The Beauties of Christianity</cite>,
which they pronounced to abound in heresies.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, M. de Chateaubriand, thoroughly convinced
of his own merit, consoled himself by affecting to laugh
with pity at such puerilities; and, happening to be about
this time godfather to a little girl, he gave her the name
of Atala; by this name, however, the priest positively
refused to christen her, whilst M. de Chateaubriand, in
his turn, insisted with all the obstinacy of an author and
all the pride of an ambassador. This affair made a noise,
and M. de Chateaubriand laid a complaint before the
Cardinal-governor; who decided in favour of the priest;
and moreover, felt highly offended on the occasion: for
M. de Chateaubriand, fancying that his services in the
cause of religion had given him a right to assume the
tone of one initiated in the secrets of the church, concluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>his argument with the Cardinal by saying: “That
it was very ridiculous that such obstacles should be thrown
in <em>his</em> way; for,” added he, “<em>between ourselves</em>, your
Eminence must know that between Atala and any other
Saint, there is no great difference.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was highly entertained by these anecdotes,
which, he said, were quite new to him, and the
person who related them observed that, although he
could not vouch for their authenticity, yet he had no doubt
of it in his own mind, having heard them from one of
the persons who succeeded M. de Chateaubriand at the
court of Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>In politics M. de Chateaubriand has been alternately
seen amongst the adherents and opponents of Napoleon;
and the Emperor charges him, when in his service, with
malevolence and want of integrity, particularly at the time
of his embassy to the old King of Sardinia at Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the disastrous event of 1814, he made himself
conspicuous by writing pamphlets so outrageously violent
and virulent, and disgraced by such barefaced calumnies,
that they excited feelings of disgust. He no doubt must
regret having been the author of them, and would not
now degrade his talents by such writings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some years before our disasters, the Emperor, reading
one day some fragments of this author’s works, expressed
his surprise that he was not a member of the Institute.
These words acted as a powerful recommendation in
favour of M. de Chateaubriand, who hastened to put
himself in the list as a candidate, and was almost unanimously
chosen.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to one of the invariable rules of the Institute,
the candidate newly chosen was to make a speech
in praise of the member to whom he was then succeeding;
but M. de Chateaubriand, persuaded, that for a man
who had once occupied the attention of the public, the
surest way to acquire celebrity was to leave the beaten
track, and strike into a new path to fame, reversed this
custom by devoting part of his speech to stigmatise the
political principles of M. Chenier his predecessor, and
proscribe him as a regicide. His speech was a complete
political argument, discussing the restoration of monarchy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>and the judgment and death of Louis XVI.; the
whole Institute was in an uproar, some of the members
refusing to listen to a speech which appeared to them
indecorous, and others, on the contrary, insisting upon its
being read. From the Institute the dispute spread rapidly
through the different circles of Paris, which were full of
the debate, and divided in opinion on the subject; and
at last reached the ears of the Emperor, to whom every
thing was carried, and who wished to be informed of
every thing. He ordered the speech to be shown to
him, pronounced it to be extravagant in the extreme,
and instantly forbade its publication. It so happened
that one of the members of the Institute, who had taken
a lively part in the discussion, and voted for the reading
of the speech, was also one of the great officers of the
Emperor’s household; and the Emperor took advantage
of this circumstance to manifest his opinion, by
addressing him in the following manner at one of his
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>couchers</em></span>:—"How long is it, sir," said he, with the
utmost severity, "since the Institute has presumed to
take the character of a political assembly? The province
of the Institute is to produce poetry and to censure faults
of language; let it beware how it forsakes the domain
of literature, or I shall take measures to bring it back
within its proper limits. And is it possible that <em>you</em>,
sir, have sanctioned such an intemperate harangue by
your approbation? If M. de Chateaubriand is insane,
or disposed to malevolence, a mad-house may cure
him, or punishment correct him; yet it may be that
the opinions he has pronounced are conscientiously his
own, and he is not obliged to surrender them to my
policy, which is unknown to him; but with you the case
is totally different—<em>you</em> are constantly near my person,
you are acquainted with all my acts, you know my will;
there <em>may</em> be an excuse in M. de Chateaubriand’s favour,
there <em>can</em> be none in yours. Sir, I hold you guilty, I
consider your conduct as criminal: it tends to bring us
back to the days of disorder and confusion, anarchy and
bloodshed. Are we then banditti? And am I but an
usurper? Sir, I did not ascend the throne by hurling
another from it; I found the crown; I picked it up out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of the kennel, and the nation placed it on my head:
respect the nation’s act. To submit facts that have so
recently occurred to public discussion in the present circumstances,
is to court fresh convulsions, and be an
enemy to the public tranquillity. The restoration of
monarchy is veiled in mystery, and must remain so;
wherefore then, I pray, this new proposed proscription
of conventionalists and regicides? Why are subjects of
so delicate a nature again brought to light? To God
alone it must belong to pronounce upon what is no longer
within the reach of the judgment of men! Are you to
be more scrupulous than the Empress? Her interests
are as dear as yours can be in this question, and much
more direct, yet she has asked no questions, she has
made no enquiries; take example from her moderation.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Have I then lost the fruit of all my labours? have
all my efforts been of so little avail that, as soon as my
presence no longer restrains you, you are ready to cut
one another’s throats?" And, in speaking thus, he paced
the room with rapid strides, and, striking his forehead
with his hand, exclaimed: "Alas! poor France, long
yet must thou need the care of a guardian.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have done all in my power,” continued he, "to
quell all your dissensions; to unite all parties has been
the constant object of my solicitude. I have made all meet
under the same roof, sit at the same board, and drink of
the same cup. I have a right to expect that you will
second my endeavours.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Since I have taken the reins of government, have
I ever inquired into the lives, actions, opinions, or writings
of any one?—Imitate my forbearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have never had but one aim, never asked but this
one question; will you sincerely assist me in promoting
the true interest of France? and all those who have answered
affirmatively have been placed by me in a defile of
granite and without outlet on either side, through which
I have urged them on to the other extremity, where my
finger pointed to the honour, the glory, and the splendour
of France.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This reprimand was so severe that the person to
whom it was addressed, a man of honour and delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>feelings, determined upon asking an audience the next
day, in order to tender his resignation. He was admitted
to the presence of the Emperor, who immediately
said to him: “My dear sir, you are come on account of
the conversation of yesterday; you felt hurt on the occasion,
and I have felt not less so; but it was a piece of
advice which I thought it right to give to more than one
person; if it has the desired effect of producing some
public good, we must neither of us regret the circumstance;
think no more about it.” And he spoke of
something else.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus would the Emperor often censure whole bodies
in the person of one single individual; and, in order to
strike with greater awe, he did it in a most solemn and
imposing manner. But the anger which he sometimes
shewed in public, and of which so much has been said,
was only feigned, and put on for the moment. The Emperor
affirmed that by such means he had often deterred
many from the commission of a fault, and spared himself
the necessity of punishing.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, at one of his grand audiences, he attacked a
Colonel with the utmost vehemence, and quite in a tone
of anger, upon some slight disorders of which his regiment
had been guilty towards the inhabitants of the
countries they had passed through, in returning to
France. During the reprimand, the Colonel, thinking
the punishment out of all proportion to the fault of
which he was accused, repeatedly endeavoured to excuse
himself; but the Emperor, without interrupting his
speech, said to him in an under-tone, “Very well, but
hold your tongue; I believe you: but say nothing:”
and when he afterwards saw him in private, he said to
him: “When I thus addressed you, I was chastising,
in your person, certain Generals whom I saw near you,
and who, had I spoken to them direct, would have been
found deserving of the lowest degradation, and perhaps
of something worse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But it sometimes happened, also, that the Emperor
was publicly appealed to: I have witnessed several instances
of this kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day at St. Cloud, at the grand audience which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>was held every Sunday, a Sub-prefect, or some other
public officer of Piedmont, who was standing by my side,
addressed the Emperor in a loud tone of voice and with
the utmost emotion, calling for justice, asserting that he
had been falsely accused, and unjustly condemned and
dismissed from the service. “Apply to my ministers,”
answered the Emperor. “No, Sire, I wish to be judged
by you.” “That is impossible, my time is wholly absorbed
with the general interests of the Empire, and my ministers
are appointed to take into consideration the particular
cases of individuals.” “But they will condemn me.”
“For what reason?” “Because every body is against me.”
“Why?” “Because I love you—to love you, Sire, is a
sufficient motive to inspire every one with hatred.” All
the bystanders were disconcerted at this answer, and red
with confusion; but the Emperor replied, with the utmost
calmness, “This is rather a strange assertion, sir, but
I am willing to hope that you are mistaken,” and he
passed on to the next person. On another occasion also,
on the parade, a young officer stepped out of the ranks,
in extreme agitation, to complain that he had been ill-used,
slighted, and passed over, and that he had been five
years a Lieutenant, without being able to obtain promotion.
“Calm yourself,” said the Emperor, “I was <em>seven</em>
years a Lieutenant, and yet you see that a man may push
himself forward for all that.” Every body laughed, and
the young officer, suddenly cooled by those few words,
returned to his place. Nothing was more common than
to see private individuals attack the Emperor, and hold
out against him, and I have often seen him thus sharply
and warmly disputed with, and unable to silence his
opponent, give up the contest by addressing another
person, or by turning the conversation to another
subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be observed, as a general principle, that, however
violent the Emperor’s actions might appear, they
were always the result of calculation. “When one of my
ministers,” said he, “or some other great personage had
been guilty of a fault of so grave a nature that it became
absolutely necessary for me to be very angry, I always
took care in that case to have a third person present to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>witness the scene that was to ensue; for it was a general
maxim, with me, that when I resolved to strike a blow
it must be felt by many at the same time; the immediate
object of my resentment did not feel more incensed
against me on that account, and the bystander, whose
embarrassed appearance was highly ludicrous, did not fail
to run and circulate, most discreetly, as far as he could,
all that he had seen and heard. A salutary terror ran
thus from vein to vein through the body social: a new
impulse was given to the march of affairs; I had less to
punish, and a great deal of public good was obtained
without inflicting much private hardship.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>REFLECTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR.—EXPENSES OF THE EMPEROR’S HOUSEHOLD AT THE TUILERIES.—OF A GOOD SYSTEM OF FINANCE.—MESSRS. MOLLIEN AND LABOUILLERIE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Sunday, 2nd.—The Emperor rode out on horseback at
about eight o’clock; he had long since abstained from
enjoying that exercise. In returning through the valley
of the Company’s garden, he went into the house of one
of the Company’s Adjutants, whose wife is a Catholic;
he remained there a few minutes only, and was in
high spirits. We next went to the house of Madame
Bertrand, to whom the Emperor paid a long visit. He
alluded, in the strongest terms, and with infinite humour,
to the behaviour of the Governor towards us; to his
paltry measures, his total want of consideration, the absurd
manner in which he conducted the affairs of the government
of the island, and his total ignorance of the business
and manners of life. “We had certainly some reason
to complain of the Admiral,” said the Emperor; “but
<em>he</em> at least was an Englishman, and this man is nothing
but an Italian <em>Sbire</em>. We have not the same manners,”
added he, “we cannot understand each other; our feelings
do not speak the same language. He probably
cannot conceive, for instance, that heaps of diamonds
would be insufficient to atone for the affront he has offered
in causing one of my domestics to be arrested almost in
my presence. Since that day all my household are in
consternation.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>On returning from our ride, we breakfasted in the
garden. In the evening, whilst we were taking an airing
in the calash, and making what we called the double
round, we beguiled the time in making an estimate of
the expenses of a man possessing an income of 150,000
livres in Paris. The Emperor said that a sixth of that
sum should go for the stables, a fourth for the table, &amp;c.
I have already said that he was fond of making such
calculations, which he always had the art of placing in a
new and unexpected light.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation led us to some details worthy of
remark on the civil list and the expenses of the Emperor’s
household. The following are amongst those I have
remembered:</p>

<p class='c001'>One million was allowed for the table, and yet the expense
of the Emperor’s own dinner did not exceed one
hundred francs a day. It had never been found possible
to manage to give him his dinner hot; for, when once
engaged in his closet, it was impossible to know when he
would leave it. Therefore, when the hour of dinner
arrived, a fowl was put on the spit for him every half hour;
and it has sometimes happened that dozens have been
roasted before that which has finally been set before him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation now turned upon the advantages of
a good administration of finances. The Emperor spoke
highly of the talents of Messrs. de Mollien and Labouillerie,
in that branch. M. de Mollien, in particular, had
put the treasury on the footing of a simple banking-house;
and the Emperor had continually under his eyes,
in a small book for that purpose, a complete statement
of the revenue, the receipt, expenditure, arrears, resources,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor had in his cellars at the Tuileries, he
added, as much as 400 millions in gold, which were entirely
his own property; so much so indeed that no other
account of it existed but in a small book in the hands of
his private Treasurer. All this treasure disappeared by
degrees, and was applied to the expenses of the Empire,
particularly at the time of our disasters. “How could I
think,” said he, “of keeping anything for myself! I had
identified myself with the nation.” He further added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>that <em>he</em> had sent 2000 millions in specie into France,
without reckoning what private individuals might have
brought on their own account.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said that he had been much hurt at the
conduct of M. de Labouillerie, who, being at Orleans in
1814, in charge of several millions belonging to him
(Napoleon), his own private property, had taken them to
the Count d’Artois in Paris instead of carrying them to
Fontainbleau, as he was in duty and in conscience bound
to do. “And yet Labouillerie was not a bad man,” said
the Emperor. “I had both loved him and esteemed him.
On my return in 1815 he earnestly entreated me to see
him and hear what he had to say in his own defence; he
no doubt would have proved that his fault arose from
his ignorance, and not from his heart. He knew me;
he was aware that, if he could approach me, the affair
would be settled with a few angry expressions on my
part; but I also knew my own weakness, I was resolved
not to take him into my service again, and therefore refused
to admit him. It was the only way in which I
could hope at that moment to hold out against him and
several others. Esteve, the predecessor of Labouillerie,
would not have acted in that manner; he was entirely
devoted to my person; he would have brought my treasure
to Fontainbleau at all hazards; or if he had failed in
the attempt, he would have thrown it into a river, or
distributed it in various places, rather than give it up.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ON WOMEN, &amp;C.—POLYGAMY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Monday, 3rd.—The Emperor, after having been three
hours in his bath, went out at about five o’clock, to take
a walk in the garden. He was taciturn and dejected,
and wore the appearance of suffering. We afterwards
drove out in the calash, and by degrees he became more
cheerful and talkative.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our return, he continued to walk for some time;
and in order to engage in a playful warfare with one of
the ladies present, he affected to declaim against women.
“We men of the West,” said he, winking aside to us at
the same time, to let us know that he was jesting, “know
nothing at all about the matter, we have acted most unwisely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>in treating women too well; we have imprudently
allowed them to rank almost as our equals. In the East
they have more sense and judgment; <em>there</em> women are
pronounced to be the actual property of man; and so
indeed they are. Nature has made them our slaves, and
it is only by presuming upon our folly that they can
aspire to govern us, and by abusing the advantages
which they possess, that they succeed in fascinating us
and establishing their dominion over us. For one woman
that inspires us with proper sentiments, there are a hundred
who lead us into errors.” He then went on to express
his approbation of the maxims of the oriental nations,
highly commended the practice of polygamy, which
he considered to be that pointed out by nature, and displayed
considerable ingenuity and fertility of invention in
the choice and number of arguments which he adduced
in support of his opinion. “Woman,” said he, "is
given to man to bear children to him; but one woman
cannot suffice to one man for that purpose, for a woman
cannot fulfil the duties of a wife during the period of her
gestation, whilst she suckles her child, or when she is
ill: and she ceases altogether to be a wife when she is
no longer able to bear children. To man, on the contrary,
nature has opposed no such obstacles at any period
of his existence; a man should therefore have several
wives.</p>

<p class='c001'>“After all,” continued he, smiling significantly, “what
have you to complain of, ladies? have we not acknowledged
that you possess a soul? though certain philosophers,
you know, have entertained doubts on this point.
You aim at equality, but <em>that</em> is madness: woman is our
property, we are not hers; for it is she that gives us
children, and not we to her; she is therefore the property
of man, in the same manner as the fruit-tree is the property
of the gardener. If the husband is unfaithful to
his wife, and he confesses his fault and repents of it,
there is an end of the matter; no trace of it is left: the
wife is angry, forgives, or becomes reconciled; and not
unfrequently is a gainer on the occasion. But the case
is widely different when the wife is unmindful of the
marriage vow; it is of no avail for her to repent; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>consequences of her guilt are incalculable, the mischief
irreparable, she must never, she can never, confess it.
You will therefore agree with me, Ladies, that it can only
be an error of judgment, the want of education, or the
preponderance of vulgar notions, that can prompt a wife
to believe herself the equal, in every respect, of her husband.
There is, however, nothing disparaging in the
inequality; each sex has its attributes and its duties;
your attributes, Ladies, are beauty, grace, fascination;
your duties, submission, and dependance, <a id='corr241.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='&amp;c.'>&amp;c.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_241.10'><ins class='correction' title='&amp;c.'>&amp;c.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor desired my son to bring
him the Memoirs of the Chevalier de Grammont and a
volume of Voltaire’s plays. Having, as he said, imposed on
himself the task of remaining up till eleven o’clock, the
Emperor read for some time the Memoirs, observing that
a very little could be rendered amusing when seasoned
with genuine wit. He afterwards turned over Mahomet,
Semiramis, and other plays of Voltaire’s, pointing out
their faults and blemishes, and concluding, as he generally
did, that Voltaire had no knowledge either of affairs,
men, or the real passions of human nature.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE EMPEROR RESUMES THE DICTATION OF HIS<br /> MEMOIRS, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Tuesday, 4th.—The Emperor sent for me at about four
o’clock to take a ride in the calash. He told me he had
at last been dictating again, and that what had been done
would not be found devoid of interest. He added that
he had been during the whole morning very much out of
humour: that he had at first attempted to go out at
about one o’clock, but that he had found himself compelled
to return into the house, pursued by disgust and
ennui; and that, not knowing what to do with himself,
he had thought of resuming his dictations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor had long since ceased to apply himself
regularly to this occupation. Several months had already
elapsed since my Campaigns of Italy were finished;
the Campaign of Egypt which he had dictated to General
Bertrand, was also completed; and General Gourgaud
had been very ill. All these circumstances had concurred
to cause interruptions, which had engendered disgust;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the Emperor had not proceeded further, and could not
summon courage to begin again.</p>

<p class='c001'>I took advantage of what he had just said, to represent
to him that to dictate was, for him, the surest,
the only remedy against <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ennui</em></span>, the only way in which
he could beguile the tedious hours: and for us, the
means of obtaining the inestimable advantage of being
put in possession of treasures, in the existence of which
the honour and glory of France were equally interested.
I urged, that it was of paramount importance that he
should continue to write his own history. “Each of
us,” said I, "would willingly give his life to obtain it; it
was due to his memory, to his family, to us. Where
would his son find the events of his father’s life faithfully
recorded? What pen could be found equal to the
task of retracing them in a manner worthy of the subject?
and yet, without such invaluable documents, how
many events would be buried with Napoleon, and remain
for ever unknown! We who surrounded him formerly,
what did we <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>then</em></span> know? how much had we not
learnt here," &amp;c. &amp;c. The Emperor replied that he
would continue his Memoirs, and consulted me as to the
plan to be followed in digesting them; should they
appear as a history? or as annals? He discussed the
point for a long time, but without coming to any
conclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>At dinner he said, “I have to-day been severely reprimanded
on account of my idleness; I am therefore
going to take to my task again, and embrace several
periods at the same time: each of you shall have his
share. Did not Herodotus,” said he, looking at me,
“give to his books the names of the muses? I intend
that each of mine shall bear the name of one of you.
Even little Emmanuel shall give his to one of them. I
will begin the history of the Consulate with Montholon,
Gourgaud shall record the events of some other period,
or detached battles; and little Emmanuel shall prepare
the documents and materials of the epoch of the coronation.”</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>MILITARY SCHOOLS.—PLAN OF EDUCATION PRESCRIBED BY THE EMPEROR.—HIS INTENTIONS IN BEHALF OF VETERANS.—CHANGES INTRODUCED IN THE MANNERS OF THE CAPITAL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Wednesday, 5th.—The Emperor went out at about
four o’clock; he had been three hours in his bath, and
did not feel well. Yet the weather was delightful; it
was like a fine afternoon in Europe. We walked until
we came up to the calash, and then took our usual drive.
Our conversation turned upon the military school of
Paris before the Revolution, and we contrasted the footing
of luxury upon which we were placed at that school
with the severe discipline introduced by the Emperor in
these establishments during his reign.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the military school of Paris we were treated in
every respect like officers of fortune, boarded and waited
upon in a style of great magnificence, greater indeed
than the circumstances of most of our families warranted,
and greater than most of us could hope to be
able to keep up in after-life. The Emperor had been
anxious, he said, to avoid falling into this error; he
had wished, above all, that his young officers, who were
one day to command soldiers, should begin by being
soldiers themselves, and learn by experience all the technical
details of the service: a system of education, he
added, which must ever prove an immense advantage to
an officer in the course of his future career, by enabling
him to follow them and to enforce the observance of
those details in others who are placed under his orders.
It was on this principle that, at St. Germain, the young
students were obliged to groom their own horses,
taught to shoe them, &amp;c. The same spirit presided over
the regulations at St. Cyr: there several pupils were
lodged together in one large apartment, a common
mess was provided for all indiscriminately, &amp;c.: yet the
attention paid to these particulars was not suffered to
interfere with the care bestowed upon the instruction
necessary to qualify them for their future career: in
short, they did not leave St. Cyr before they had really
earned the rank of officers, and were found capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>leading and commanding soldiers. “And it must be
admitted,” the Emperor observed, “that if the young
men who passed from that institution, at its origin, into
different corps of the army, were at first viewed with
jealousy, ample justice was soon rendered to their discipline
and to their abilities.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The establishments of Ecouen, St. Denis and others,
which the benevolent solicitude of Napoleon had created
for the daughters of members of the legion of honour,
were conducted upon principles of a similar nature.
Some of the rules, made by the Emperor himself, ordered
that every article for the use of the institution
should be made in the house and by the hands of the
pupils themselves, and forbade every species of luxury,
extravagance in dress, and plays; the object being, he
said, to form good housewives and respectable women.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public opinion had given to Napoleon, at the time of
his elevation, the reputation of a man of a harsh disposition
and void of sensibility; yet it is certain that no
sovereign ever acted more from the impulse of genuine
feelings than he did; but, from a peculiar turn of mind,
he concealed all emotions of the heart with as much
care as others take to display them.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had adopted all the children of the soldiers
and officers killed at Austerlitz, and with him such an
act was not one of mere form; he had provided for
them all.</p>

<p class='c001'>I heard the following anecdote from a young man who
has related it to me since my return to Europe, with
tears of gratitude. Having been fortunate enough,
when yet very young, to attract the Emperor’s notice
by some signal proof of his attachment; Napoleon asked
him what profession he would wish to embrace; and,
without waiting for his answer, pointed out one himself.
The young man observed that his father’s fortune
was not sufficient to allow him to follow it. “What
signifies that?” replied the Emperor hastily: “Am I
not also your father?” Those persons who have known
Napoleon in his private life, who have lived near his
person, can relate a thousand traits of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had done much for the army and the veterans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and proposed to do much more: every day some new
thought tending to that object occupied his mind. The
plan of a decree was one day laid before us in the Council
of State, proposing that in future all vacant situations
in the customs, the collection of the revenue, and
the excise, should be given to wounded soldiers, or to
veterans capable of filling them, from the private up to
the highest ranks in the army. This plan being coldly
received, the Emperor addressed one of those who opposed
it in his usual manner, urging him to discuss the
question freely, and state his opinion without reserve.
“Sire,” answered M. Malouet, “my objection is that
I fear the other classes of the nation will feel themselves
aggrieved in seeing the army preferred to them.” “Sir,”
replied the Emperor warmly, “you make a distinction
which does not exist; the army no longer forms a
separate class of the nation. In the situation in which
we are now placed no member of the state is exempt
from being a soldier; to follow a military career is no
longer a matter of choice, it is one of necessity. The
greatest number of those who are engaged in that
career have been compelled to abandon their own profession
against their will, it is therefore but justice that
they should receive some kind of compensation for it.”—"But,"
again observes the member who opposed the
plan, “will it not be inferred that your majesty intends
that in future almost all vacant situations shall be given
to soldiers?”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“And such is indeed my intention,” said the Emperor.
“Sir, the only question is, whether I have the
right to do so, and whether I thereby commit an act of
injustice? Now the constitution gives me the nomination
to all places, and I think it a principle of strict
equity that those who have suffered most have the
greatest claims to be indemnified.” Then, raising his
voice, he added, “Gentlemen, war is not a profession of
ease and comfort: quietly seated on your benches here
you know it only by reading our bulletins, or by hearing
of our triumphs. You know nothing of our nightly
watches, our forced marches, the sufferings and privations
of every kind to which we are exposed: but I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>know them, because I witness them, and sometimes
share in them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This plan, however, like many others, was at last
abandoned, after having been several times under discussion
and variously modified; and the beneficent intentions
of the Emperor were, I believe, not even known
to the public, though he had appeared to take a lively
interest in the passing of this decree, and had defended
it in its most minute details.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amongst the objections started against this plan, at
the commencement of the discussion, and the arguments
to which they gave rise, were the following:—"Would
your majesty, for instance, give such situations to a
soldier who could not read?"—"Why not?"—"But
how would he be able to discharge his duties? how could
he keep his accounts?"—"Sir, he would apply to his
neighbour, he would send for his relations, and the
benefit intended for one would be felt by many. Besides,
I do not hold your objection to be valid; we have
only to stipulate that the man appointed shall be qualified
to fill the situation," &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Towards evening, the Emperor sent for me to his own
room. I found him alone, near a small fire, but almost
in the dark, the lights being placed in the next apartment.
This obscurity, he said, was in harmony with his
melancholy. He was silent and dejected.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner the Emperor took up the Memoirs of the
Chevalier de Grammont, but found himself unable to
continue to read them.</p>

<p class='c001'>A discussion then arose upon the manner in which
time was spent in Paris. The habits of society in former
times and the present were reviewed. The Emperor
said he had thought much and often upon the means of
introducing variety into the pleasures of society. He
had had assemblies at Court, plays, excursions to Fontainbleau,
but they had only produced the effect, he said,
of inconveniencing the people at Court without influencing
the circles of the metropolis. There was not yet a sufficient
degree of cohesion in those heterogeneous parts
for them to re-act upon each other with due effect: but
this, he affirmed, would have been brought about in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>course of time. It was observed to him that he had
much contributed to shorten the evenings at Paris, as
all persons employed by government, having a great
deal to do, and being obliged to rise very early, were
under the necessity of retiring early. “It caused, however,
great surprise in Paris,” said the Emperor, “produced
quite a revolution in manners, and almost stirred
up a sedition in the circles of the metropolis, when the
First Consul required that boots should be relinquished
for shoes, and that some little attention should be bestowed
upon dress to appear in company.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor dwelt with great pleasure upon the
causes of the good-breeding and amiable manners which
distinguished society in our younger days. He defined
particularly those points which contributed to render
intimacy agreeable, such as a slight tinge of flattery
on both sides, or, at least, an opposition seasoned with
delicacy and politeness, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>REPUGNANCE TO PHYSIC.—GIL BLAS.—GENERAL BIZANET.—HEROIC DEEDS OF FRENCH VALOUR.—REFLECTIONS, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Thursday, 6th.—I did not see the Emperor before six
o’clock; being indisposed, he had remained in his room,
and had not eaten any thing the whole day. He said
that he found himself unwell, and was amusing himself
by looking over some prints of London which the Doctor
had lent him. The Doctor had had the honour of
seeing the Emperor in the course of the day, and had
made him laugh. “Hearing that I was not well,” said
Napoleon, “he claimed me as his prey, by immediately
advising me to take some medicine; medicine to me,
who, to the best of my recollection, never took any in
the whole course of my life!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was now past seven: the Emperor said that a man
who felt hungry was not very ill. He called for something
to eat, and a chicken was brought to him, which
he highly relished. This revived his spirits a little, he
became more talkative, and made remarks on several
French novels. He had been employed the greater part
of the day in reading Gil Blas, which he thought full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>wit; but the hero and all his companions, he said, had
deserved to be sent to the galleys. He then turned over
a chronological register, and stopped at the brilliant affair
of Bergenopzoom, commanded by General Bizanet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many gallant actions,” said the Emperor,
“have been either forgotten in the confusion of our disasters,
or overlooked in the number of our exploits. The
affair of Bergenopzoom is one of these. A competent garrison
for that town would have been probably from eight
to ten thousand men, but it did not then contain more
than two thousand seven hundred. An English General,
favoured by the darkness of the night, and by the intelligence
which he kept up with the inhabitants, had succeeded
in penetrating into it, at the head of four thousand
eight hundred chosen men. They are in the town,
the inhabitants are on their side, but nothing can
triumph over French valour! A desperate engagement
takes place in the streets, and nearly the whole of the
English troops are killed or remain prisoners. That is
undoubtedly, exclaimed the Emperor, a gallant action!
General Bizanet is a gallant officer!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is certain, as Napoleon had observed, that, in the
last moments of the Empire, numberless heroic deeds and
historical traits have been overlooked in the confusion of
our disasters, or have disappeared in the abyss of our
misfortunes. Such are the extraordinary and singular
defence of Huningen, by the intrepid Barbanegre; and
the gallant resistance of General Teste at Namur, where,
in an open town, with a handful of brave fellows, he stopped
short the rapid advance of the Prussians, and facilitated
the re-entry of Grouchy, without suffering any loss.
Such was the brilliant expedition of the brave Excelmans
in Versailles, which might have produced most important
results, if it had been supported as it had been decided
that it should be; and several others.</p>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, these noble deeds at that critical period,
have shed lustre on the ranks of the army rather than on
its principal leaders. It would have been well, if, at the
moment of that terrible catastrophe, during that fatal
crisis, some of our first generals had again exhibited some
of those noble acts of courage, those signal efforts, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>marked our first triumphs, and which, under Napoleon’s
reign, had become almost a national habit; whatever the
result might have been, the attempt would have been a
source of consolation to our glory, and France would
have contemplated with satisfaction the heroic convulsions
of her agony. We ought not to have terminated
our career by common actions.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that calamitous period, we had more troops abroad
than at home: Dresden contained an army: a second
army was shut up in Hamburg; a third in Dantzick;
and a fourth might have been easily collected by bringing
together the immense number of our soldiers, which
formed several other intermediate garrisons. All the
efforts of our enemies tended only to keep these brave
troops separated from France, and to cut off their return.
Oh! that some one of their leaders had been inspired
with the thought to take advantage of those circumstances
to liberate the sacred soil, by attacking boldly
that of the enemy, and obliging him thus to retrace his
steps! Would it have been impossible to unite those
different corps?</p>

<p class='c001'>Would not the union of the garrisons of Dresden,
Torgau, Magdeburg, Hamburg, have produced a formidable
army in the rear of the enemy, capable of breaking
through his line, or of placing him in a most critical
situation? Might not such an army have taken possession
of Berlin, liberated the garrisons on the Oder, gone
to the assistance of Dantzick, raised an insurrection in
Poland, so well prepared for it, or, in short, done something
bold, striking, unexpected, in a word, worthy of us?</p>

<p class='c001'>What then was required to give a favourable turn to
our destinies? the most trifling event, before the Allies
entered France, would have sufficed to enable us to conclude
a peace on reasonable terms at Francfort; and, at
a later period, when the enemy was already in our own
territory, the slightest cause of uneasiness in his rear at
the time of the heroic actions of Champaubert, Montmirail,
Vauchamp, Craon, Monterau, would probably have
determined the hasty retreat of the Allies, and insured
our triumph, and perhaps their destruction. And, if
the general who had thus dared to devote himself had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>failed in the attempt, it would not have been the
worse for us, since we have ultimately fallen; and he,
in the spirit of our national character, would have
gained the reputation of a hero and rendered his name
immortal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of this, about one hundred thousand men were
lost to France, by tamely adhering to the letter of their
instructions; a system which we had long since abandoned.
But perhaps I speak inconsiderately and without
due knowledge of the subject; perhaps local circumstances
and objections of which I am totally ignorant
might be adduced as conclusive answers against me;
such as the health of the troops, the state of destitution
in which they were; the non-reception of orders from
the Emperor, who did endeavour to give some orders of
that kind; the fear of deranging the main plan; the
dread of incurring too great a responsibility, &amp;c. But is
it not rather that the source of these high conceptions,
and the cause of their heroic execution, were to be found
in Napoleon alone, and that where <em>he</em> was not, as it may
have been often observed, affairs were suffered to sink
to the level of their ordinary course? Be that as it may,
something of the kind was however suggested to the
General commanding the army in Dantzick, at the time
of the capitulation of that town. The idea came from
an officer of inferior rank, it is true, but from one whose
courage and intrepidity, and the success with which they
had been crowned, entitled him perhaps to give such an
opinion: it was Captain de Chambure, the leader of that
renowned company of partisans which covered itself
with glory during the siege. This company had been
formed for that particular service, of one hundred picked
men chosen out of the most notoriously intrepid, throughout
all the corps of the army; it fulfilled, and even exceeded,
all the expectations which it had raised; and the
besiegers, struck with terror at its exploits, honoured it
with the epithet of <em>infernal</em>. It would sometimes land
at night in the rear of the Russian army, slaughter their
sentinels, spike their guns, burn their magazines, destroy
their parks, threaten the lives even of the generals, and
return to the town through the enemies’ camp over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>bodies of all who opposed its passage. These facts and
several others are recorded in the general orders of that
army.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be denied that, in ordinary times, in the
days that preceded ours, every one of these actions
would have been sufficient to immortalize every individual
who had a share in them, and that even amidst the
wonders of our age they are deserving of particular
notice. On his return from Elba, Napoleon was desirous
of seeing the brave Chambure, who was covered with
wounds: he was accordingly introduced to the Emperor
by the Minister of War, and was immediately appointed
to the command of a partisan corps on the eastern
frontiers of France, where he again shewed himself
worthy of his fame. Two English officers fell into his
hands in the very heart of France, and at the moment of
the violent exasperation produced by the recent disasters
which had again befallen us. De Chambure protected
these officers from the fury of his own soldiers, and
preserved their equipages and even their baggage. Will
it be believed? Some time afterwards, this officer, whose
courage, loyalty, and above all, whose noble conduct
were deserving of the highest recompense, was by a
French tribunal condemned to the galleys for life, and to
be branded and exposed in the pillory, for having, it
was said, stopped and robbed two officers of the enemy’s
army on the highway! Such is the justice of party-spirit!
Such the monstrous aberrations to which the
judgment and the consciences of men can be reconciled
by the effervescence of civil commotions!</p>

<p class='c001'>Under these circumstances, no alternative was left to
Colonel de Chambure but a speedy retreat from his own
country: it was in vain that from his exile he endeavoured
to make the truth known; it was in vain that
the two English officers gave the most extensive publicity
to the testimonials of their gratitude: a considerable
time elapsed before Colonel de Chambure could seize the
opportunity of a moment of political calm, to deliver up
his person to the tribunals, and call for a revision of his
trial.—That revision took place, and this time the result
was a declaration that there were not even any grounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of accusation against him! This is indeed one of the
peculiar signs of the times!</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE EMPEROR’S IMAGINARY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.—NAPOLEON LITTLE KNOWN EVEN BY HIS HOUSEHOLD—HIS RELIGIOUS OPINIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>From Friday 7th to Saturday 8th.—During a long
private conversation, this morning, the Emperor reverted
to all the horrors of our present situation, and enumerated
all the chances which hope suggested of better
days.</p>

<p class='c001'>After his remarks on these topics, which I cannot
repeat here, he gave the rein to his imagination, and
said that the only countries in which he could reside for
the future were England and America. His inclination,
he added, prompted for America, because <em>there</em> he
should be really free, and independence and repose were
all he now sighed for: then followed an imaginary plan
of life: he fancied himself with his brother Joseph, in
the midst of a little France, &amp;c. Yet policy, he observed,
might decide for England. He was bound perhaps to
remain a slave to events—he owed the sacrifice of himself
to a nation which had done more for him than he
had done for it in return; and then followed another
imaginary plan for the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of our subsequent conversation, the
Emperor could not sufficiently express his surprise at the
conviction, which he had obtained, that several of those
who surrounded him and formed his Court, believed the
greatest part of the many absurdities and idle reports
which had been circulated respecting himself, and that
they even went so far as to doubt the falsehood of the
enormities with which his reputation had been stained.—Thus
we believed that he wore armour in the midst of
us—was addicted to the superstition of presentiments
and fatality—subject to fits of madness or of epilepsy—that
he had strangled Pichegru—caused a poor English
captain’s throat to be cut, &amp;c. We could not but
admit that his invective against us on the occasion was
merited; all we could allege in our defence was that
many circumstances had concurred to leave those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>formerly surrounded his person as much in ignorance
on the subject as the bulk of the nation could be. We
frequently saw him, I said, but we never held any communication
with him: every thing remained a mystery
for us. Not a voice was raised to refute, whilst many
in secret, and some that were nearest to his person,
either through perverseness, or with bad intentions,
seemed ever busy in dealing out insinuations. As for
myself, I candidly confessed that I had not formed a just
idea of his disposition before I came here, although I
could congratulate myself that I had certainly guessed
him in part. “And yet,” he observed in reply, “<em>you</em> have
often seen me and heard me in the Council of State.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the evening, after dinner, the conversation turned
upon religion. The Emperor dwelt on the subject at
length. The following is a faithful summary of his
arguments; I give it as being quite characteristic upon
a point which has probably often excited the curiosity
of many.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, after having spoken for some time with
warmth and animation, said: “Every thing proclaims
the existence of a God, <em>that</em> cannot be questioned; but
all our religions are evidently the work of men. Why
are there so many?—Why has ours not always existed?—Why
does it consider itself exclusively the right one?—What
becomes in that case of all the virtuous men
who have gone before us?—Why do these religions
revile, oppose, exterminate one another?—Why has this
been the case ever and every where?—Because men are
ever men; because priests have ever and every where
introduced fraud and falsehood. However, as soon as
I had power, I immediately re-established religion. I
made it the ground-work and foundation upon which I
built. I considered it as the support of sound principles
and good morality, both in doctrine and in practice.
Besides, such is the restlessness of man, that his mind
requires that something undefined and marvellous which
religion offers; and it is better for him to find it there,
than to seek it of Cagliostro, of Mademoiselle Lenormand,
or of the fortune-tellers and impostors.” Somebody
having ventured to say to him that he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>possibly in the end become devout, the Emperor
answered, with an air of conviction, that he feared not,
and that it was with regret he said it; for it was no
doubt a great source of consolation; but that his incredulity
did not proceed from perverseness or from
licentiousness of mind, but from the strength of his
reason. “Yet,” added he, “no man can answer for
what will happen, particularly in his last moments. At
present I certainly believe that I shall die without a
confessor; and yet there is one (pointing to one of us)
who will perhaps receive my confession. I am assuredly
very far from being an atheist, but I cannot believe all
that I am taught in spite of my reason, without being
false and a hypocrite. When I became Emperor, and
particularly after my marriage with Maria Louisa, every
effort was made to induce me to go with great pomp,
according to the custom of the Kings of France, to take
the sacrament at the church of Notre Dame; but this
I positively refused to do: I did not believe in the act
sufficiently to derive any benefit from it, and yet I
believed too much in it to run the risk of committing a
profanation.” On this occasion a certain person was
alluded to, who had boasted, as it were, that he had
never taken the sacrament. “That is very wrong,” said
the Emperor; “either he has not fulfilled the intention
of his education, or his education was neglected.” Then,
resuming the subject, he said, “To explain where I
come from, what I am, and whither I go, is above my
comprehension; and yet all that is. I am like the
watch that exists, without possessing the consciousness
of existence. However, the sentiment of religion is
so consolatory that it must be considered as a gift of
Heaven: what a resource would it not be for us here to
possess it! What influence could men and events
exercise over me, if, bearing my misfortunes as if inflicted
by God, I expected to be compensated by him with
happiness hereafter! What rewards have <em>I</em> not a right
to expect who have run a career so extraordinary, so
tempestuous, without committing a single crime, and
yet how many might I not have been guilty of? I can
appear before the tribunal of God, I can await his judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>without fear. He will not find my conscience
stained with the thoughts of murder and poisonings,
with the infliction of violent and premeditated death,
events so common in the history of those whose lives
have resembled mine. I have striven only for the glory,
the power, the greatness of France. All my faculties,
all my efforts, all my moments, were directed to the
attainment of that object. These cannot be crimes; to me
they appeared acts of virtue. What then would be my
happiness, if the bright prospect of futurity presented
itself to crown the last moments of my existence!”</p>

<p class='c001'>After a pause, he resumed. "How is it possible that
conviction can find its way to our hearts, when we hear
the absurd language, and witness the acts of iniquity, of
the greatest number of those whose business it is to
preach to us? I am surrounded by priests, who repeat
incessantly that their reign is not of this world, and
yet they lay hands upon every thing that they can get.
The Pope is the head of that religion from heaven, and
he thinks only of this world. What did the present
Chief Pontiff, who is undoubtedly a good, and a holy
man, not offer to be allowed to return to Rome! The
surrender of the government of the church, of the
institution of bishops, was not too high a price for him
to give, to become once more a secular prince. Even
now, he is the friend of all the Protestants, who grant
him every thing, because they do not fear him. He is
only the enemy of catholic Austria, because her territory
surrounds his own.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless,” he observed again, “it cannot be
doubted that, as Emperor, the species of incredulity which
I felt was favourable to the nations I had to govern.
How could I have favoured equally sects so opposed to
one another, if I had been under the influence of any one
of them? How could I have preserved the independence
of my thoughts, and of my actions, under the controul
of a confessor, who would have governed me by the
dread of hell? What power cannot a wicked man, the
most stupid of mankind, thus exercise over those by
whom whole nations are governed? Is it not the scene-shifter
at the opera, who from behind the scenes, moves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Hercules at his will? Who can doubt that the last years
of Louis XIV. would have been very different, had he
been directed by another confessor? I was so deeply impressed
with the truth of these opinions that I promised
to do all in my power to bring up my son in the same
religious persuasion which I myself entertain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor ended the conversation by desiring my
son to bring him the New Testament; and, taking it
from the beginning, he read as far as the conclusion of
the discourse of Jesus on the mount. He expressed
himself struck with the highest admiration, of the purity,
the sublimity, the beauty of the morality which it contained;
and we all experienced the same feeling.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>PORTRAIT OF THE DIRECTORS.—ANECDOTES.—18TH<br /> FRUCTIDOR.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Sunday, 9th.—The Emperor spoke much of the creation
of the Directory; he had installed it, being then Commander-in-chief
of the Army of the Interior. This led
him to review the five Directors, whose portraits and
characters he drew. He gave a lively picture of their
follies and their faults, and this led him to the events of
Fructidor, and furnished many curious particulars. I
have collected the following, partly, from some of his
desultory conversations, and, partly, from his dictation
of the campaigns of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Barras,” said the Emperor, "of a good family in
Provence, was an officer in the regiment of the Isle of
France; at the revolution, he was chosen Deputy to the
National Convention for the department of the Var. He
had no talent for oratory, and no habits of business.
After the 31st of May, he was, together with Freron,
appointed Commissioner to the army of Italy, and to
Provence, which was then the seat of civil war. On his
return to Paris, he threw himself into the Thermidorian
party; threatened by Robespierre, as well as Tallien and
the remainder of Danton’s party, they united, and brought
about the events of the 9th Thermidor. At the moment
of the crisis, the Convention named him to march against
the <em>commune</em>, which had risen in favour of Robespierre;
he succeeded.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>"This event gave him great celebrity. After the
downfall of Robespierre, all the Thermidorians became
the leading men of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>"At the critical period of the 12th Vendemiaire, it
was determined, in order to get rid at once of the three
Commissioners to the Army of the Interior, to unite in
the person of Barras the power of Commissioner and
Commander of that army. But the circumstances in
which he was placed were too much for him; they were
above his powers. Barras had no experience in war, he
had quitted the service when only a captain; he had no
knowledge of military affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The events of Thermidor and of Vendemiaire brought
him into the Directory; he did not possess the qualifications
requisite to fill that situation, but he acted better
than was expected from him by those who knew him.</p>

<p class='c001'>"He kept up a splendid establishment, had a pack of
hounds, and his expenses were considerable. When he
quitted the Directory, on the 18th Brumaire, he had still
a large fortune, and he did not attempt to conceal it.
That fortune was not large enough to have contributed
in the least to the derangement of the finances, but the
manner in which it had been acquired, by favouring the
contractors, impaired the public morals.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Barras was tall; he spoke sometimes in moments
of agitation, and his voice filled the house. His intellectual
capacity did not allow him to go beyond a few
sentences, but the animation with which he spoke would
have produced the impression that he was a man of resolution;
this however he was not; and he had no opinion
of his own upon any part of the administration of
public affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In Fructidor, he formed with Rewbel and La Reveillere
Lepaux, the majority against Carnot and Barthelemy;
after that event he became to all appearance the most
important member of the Directory, but, in reality, it was
Rewbel who possessed the greatest influence. Barras
always appeared in public the warm friend of Napoleon.
At the time of the 30th Prairial, he had the art to conciliate
the preponderating party in the assembly, and he
did not share the disgrace of his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“La Reveillere Lepaux, born at Angers, belonged
to the lower ranks of the middling class of society.
He was short, and his person was as unprepossessing
as can well be imagined; he was a true Æsop. He
wrote tolerably well, but his mind was narrow, and he
had neither habits of business nor knowledge of mankind.
He was alternately governed, according to circumstances,
by Carnot or Rewbel. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Jardin des
Plantes</em></span>, and the Theophilanthropy, a new religion of
which he had the folly to become the founder, occupied
all his time. In other respects, he was a patriot, warm
and sincere, an honest man, and a citizen full of probity
and of learning; he was poor when he became a member
of the Directory, and poor when he left it. Nature had
not qualified him to occupy any higher station than that
of an inferior magistrate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon, after his return from the army of Italy,
found himself, without knowing why, the object of the
particular assiduity, the marked attentions and flatteries
of the Director La Reveillere, who asked him one day
to dine with him, strictly <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en famille</em></span>, in order, he said,
that they might be more at liberty to converse together.
The young General accepted the invitation, and found,
as he had promised, nobody present but the Director, his
wife, and his daughter, “who, by the way,” added the
Emperor, “were three paragons of ugliness.” After the
dessert, the two ladies retired, and the conversation took
a serious turn. La Reveillere descanted at length upon
the disadvantages of our religion, upon the necessity,
however, of having one, and extolled and enumerated
the advantages of the religion which he wanted to establish,
the Theophilanthropy. “I was beginning to find
the conversation rather tedious and dull,” said the Emperor,
“when, on a sudden, La Reveillere, rubbing his
hands with an air of satisfaction, said to me affectedly,
and with an arch look: ‘How valuable the acquisition
of a man like you would be to us!—what advantage,
what weight would be derived from your name!—and
how glorious that circumstance would be to you!—Now
what do you think of it?’”—The young General was far
from expecting to receive such a proposal; however, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>replied with humility, that he did not think himself
worthy of such an honour; and his principles being,
when treading an obscure path, to follow the track of
those who had preceded him in it, he was resolved to act,
in the article of religion, as his father and mother had
done. This positive answer convinced the high-priest
that nothing was to be done; he did not insist, but from
that moment there was an end of all his attentions and
flatteries towards the young General.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rewbel,” said the Emperor, "born in Alsace, was
one of the best lawyers in the town of Colmar. He
possessed that kind of intelligence which denotes a man
skilled in the practice of the bar,—his influence was
always felt in deliberations,—he was easily inspired with
prejudices—did not believe much in the existence of
virtue—and his patriotism was tinged with a degree of
enthusiasm. It is problematical whether he did or did
not amass a fortune, during the time he was in the
Directory; he was surrounded by contractors, it is true,—but,
with his turn of mind, it is possible that he only
amused himself by conversing with men of activity and
enterprise, and that he enjoyed their flatteries, without
making them pay for the complaisance which he shewed
them. He bore a particular hatred to the Germanic
system—he displayed great energy in the assemblies,
both before and after the period of his being a magistrate,
and was fond of a life of application and activity.
He had been a member of the Constituent Assembly,
and of the Convention; by the latter he was appointed
Commissioner at Mentz, where he gave no proofs of
firmness or of military talent; he contributed to the
surrender of the city, which might have held out longer.
Like all lawyers, he had imbibed from his profession a
prejudice against the army.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Carnot, born in Burgundy, had entered when very
young the corps of engineers, and shewed himself an
advocate of the system of Montalembert. He was considered
by his companions as an eccentric character, and
was already a knight of the order of St. Louis at the
commencement of the revolution, the principles of which
he warmly espoused. He became a member of the Convention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and was one of the committee of public welfare
with Robespierre, Barrère, Couthon, Saint-Juste, Billaud-Varennes,
Collot-d’Herbois, &amp;c. He was particularly
inveterate against the nobility, and found himself, in consequence,
frequently engaged in quarrels with Robespierre,
who, towards the close of his life, had taken a
great many nobles under his protection.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Carnot was laborious, sincere on every occasion, but
unaccustomed to intrigue and easily deceived. He was
attached to Jourdan, as Commissioner from the Convention,
at the time when Jourdan was employed in relieving
the town of Mentz, which was besieged; and he
rendered some services on the occasion. In the Committee
of Public Welfare, he directed the operations of
the war, and was found useful, but he had neither experience
nor practice in the military matters. He displayed
on every occasion great moral courage.</p>

<p class='c001'>"After the events of Thermidor, when the Convention
caused all the members of the committee of Public Welfare
to be arrested, with the exception of himself, Carnot
insisted upon sharing their fate. This conduct was the
more noble, inasmuch as public opinion had pronounced
itself violently against the Committee. He was nominated
a member of the Directory after Vendemiaire; but after
the 9th Thermidor his mind was deeply affected by the
reproaches of public opinion, which attributed to the
committee all the blood which had flowed on the scaffold.
He felt the necessity of gaining esteem, and, believing
that he took the lead, he suffered himself to be led by
some of those who directed the party from abroad. His
merit was then extolled to the skies, but he did not
deserve the praises of the enemies of France; he found
himself placed in a critical situation, and fell in
Fructidor.</p>

<p class='c001'>"After the 18th Brumaire, Carnot was recalled by
the First Consul and placed in the department of war;
he had several quarrels with the Minister of the Finances
and Dufrenes the Director of the Treasury, in which it is
but fair to say that he was always in the wrong. At
last, he left the department, persuaded that it could no
longer go on for want of money.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>"When a member of the Tribunate, he spoke and
voted against the establishment of the Empire; but his
conduct, open and manly, gave no uneasiness to the
administration. At a later period, he was appointed
Chief Inspector of Reviews, and received from the Emperor,
on his retiring from the service, a pension of
twenty thousand francs. As long as things went on
prosperously, the Emperor heard nothing of him: but,
after the campaign of Russia, at the time of the disasters
of France, Carnot solicited to be employed: he was
appointed to command the town of Antwerp, and he
behaved well at his post. On his return in 1815, the
Emperor, after a little hesitation, appointed him to be
Minister of the Interior, and had no cause to repent of
having done so; he found him faithful, laborious, full
of probity, and always sincere. In the month of June,
Carnot was named one of the Commission of the Provisional
Government, but being unfit for the place, he
was duped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Le Tourneur de la Manche was born in Normandy;
he had been an officer of engineers before the revolution.
It is difficult to explain how he came to be appointed to
the Directory; it can only be from one of those unaccountable
caprices of which large assemblies so often
furnish examples. He was a man of narrow capacity,
little learning, and of a weak mind. There were in the
Convention five hundred deputies better qualified for
the situation; he was however a man of strict probity,
and left the Directory without any fortune.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Le Tourneur made himself the talk and the laughing-stock
of Paris; it was said that he came from his
department to take possession at the Directory in a cart,
with his house-keeper, his kitchen utensils, and his
poultry. The wags of the capital marked him, and
he was overwhelmed with ridicule. He was made, for
instance, to return from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Jardin des Plantes</em></span>, whither
he had run immediately on his arrival in Paris, and to
give an account of the rare things he had found there;
and, on being asked whether he had seen Lacepede,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>was surprised that he should have passed it unobserved,
declaring that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>la Giraffe</em></span> (the camelopard) was the only
thing that had been pointed out to him.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>"The Directory was hardly established before it
began to lower itself in public estimation by caprices,
bad morals, and false measures. The faults and absurdities
which it committed daily completed its discredit,
and it was lost in reputation almost at the very moment
of its formation. Intoxicated with their elevation, the
Directors thought it became them to adopt a certain air,
and sought to acquire the appearance and manners of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bon ton</em></span>. In order the better to succeed, they formed
each a little Court, where they received and welcomed
the higher classes, hitherto in disgrace, and who were
naturally their enemies, and from which they excluded
the greatest part of their old acquaintances and former
companions, as thenceforward too vulgar. All those
who during the Revolution had shown more energy than
the members of the Directory, or who had trodden in
the same path with them, became odious to them and
were immediately kept aloof; and the Directory thus
rendered itself ridiculous to one party, and alienated the
affections of the other. These five little Courts exacted a
greater degree of servility in proportion as they were
inferior and ridiculous; but numbers of men were found
who could not bring themselves to bend and submit to
formalities which the recollection of recent circumstances,
the nature of the government and the character of
the governors, rendered inadmissible.</p>

<p class='c001'>"However, all the Directory could do to gain over
the saloons of Paris proved of no avail: it did not
succeed in acquiring any influence over them, and the
Bourbon party was gaining ground. No sooner did the
Directors perceive this than they hastily retraced their
steps; but it was too late to recover the good-will of
the republicans, whom they had estranged by their
conduct. This led to a system of wavering, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>looked like caprice; no course was laid down to steer by,
no object was kept in view, no unity prevailed. The
reigns of terror and of royalty were equally objected to;
but in the mean time the road which was to lead to the
goal was left untried. The Directory thought to put an
end to this state of uncertainty and to avoid these perpetual
waverings, by striking at one blow the two
extreme parties, whether they had deserved it or not:
if therefore a royalist, who had conspired or disturbed
the public tranquillity, was arrested by their orders, they
caused a republican, innocent or guilty, to be arrested at
the same moment. This system was nicknamed <em>The
Political Seesaw</em>, but the injustice and fraud which characterized
it entirely discredited the government; every
heart was closed; it was a government of lead. Every
true and generous feeling was against the Directory.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Men of business, jobbers and intriguers, by possessing
themselves of the springs of government, acquired
the greatest influence; all places were given
to worthless individuals, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>protégés</em></span>, or to relations—corruption
crept into every branch of the administration.
This was soon perceived, and those who had it in their
power to waste the public money could act without fear;
the foreign relations, the armies, the finances, the department
of the Interior, all felt the pernicious effects of
so vicious a system. This state of things soon gathered
a storm on the political horizon, and we proceeded with
rapid strides to the crisis of Fructidor.</p>

<p class='c001'>"At that period the measures of the Directory were
weak, capricious, and uncertain; emigrants returned to
France, and newspapers, paid by foreigners, dared openly
to stigmatize the most deserving of our patriots. The
fury of the enemies of our national glory exasperated the
soldiers of the army of Italy, which declared itself loudly
against them; whilst the Councils, in their turn, acting
the parts of real counter-revolutionists, spoke of nothing
but priests, bells, and emigrants. All the officers of the
army, who had distinguished themselves more or less in
the departments, in the battalions of volunteers, or even
in the regiments of the line, finding themselves thus
attacked in their dearest interests, inflamed more and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>more the anger of their soldiers; the minds of all parties
were in a state of effervescence. In a moment of such
violent agitation, what measures could the General of
the army of Italy adopt? He had the choice of three:</p>

<p class='c001'>“1st. To side with the preponderating party in the
Councils—but it was too late; the army had declared
itself, and the leaders of that party, the orators of the
Council, by attacking incessantly both the General and
his army, had not left him the possibility of adopting
that resolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>2dly. “To embrace the party of the Directory and
of the Republic. That was the plainest course, that
which duty pointed out, which the army inclined to, and
in which he was already engaged; for all the writers
who had remained faithful to the cause of the Revolution
had declared themselves, of their own accord, the ardent
defenders and warm advocates of the army and its
commanders.</p>

<p class='c001'>3dly. “To overpower both factions, by stepping
forward boldly and appearing openly in the contest as
regulator of the Republic. But notwithstanding the
strength which Napoleon felt that he derived from the
support of the army, although his character was highly
esteemed in France, he did not think that the spirit of
the times and public opinion were such as to allow him
to take so daring a step. And besides, if this third
measure had been that to which he secretly inclined, he
could not have adopted it immediately, and without
having previously sided with one of the two parties,
which appeared at that moment in the political lists. It
was absolutely necessary, even in order to form a third
party, to side first either with the Councils or with the
Directory.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus, of the three measures to be adopted, the third
in its execution merged into the two first, and he was
entirely debarred from adopting the first of these two by
the new formation of the Councils, and by the attacks
already made upon him by them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These considerations and conclusions,” the Emperor
observed, “were the natural result of a deep meditation
upon the then existing state of affairs in France. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>General had therefore nothing to do but to let events
take their course, and second the impulse of his troops.
And this view of the subject produced the proclamation
to the army of Italy, and the far-famed order of the day
of its General.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Soldiers!’ he said, ‘I know that your hearts are full
of grief at the calamities of our country; but, if it were
possible that foreign armies should triumph, we would fly
from the summit of the Alps with the rapidity of the
eagle, to defend once more that cause which has already
cost us so much blood.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“These words decided the question; the soldiers, in
ecstasy, were for marching at once upon Paris. The
rumour of the event spread immediately to the capital,
and produced a most powerful sensation. The Directory,
which every body considered as lost, which the moment
before was tottering alone and abandoned, found itself
at once supported by public opinion; it immediately
assumed the attitude, and followed the course of a
triumphant party, and defeated all its enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The General of the army of Italy had sent the proclamation
to his soldiers to the Directory by Augereau,
because he was a Parisian and strongly in favour of the
prevailing notions of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nevertheless, the politicians of the day made the
following surmises: What would Napoleon have done if
the Councils had triumphed; if that faction, instead of
being overthrown, had, on the contrary, overthrown the
Directory? In that case, it appears, that he was determined
to march upon Lyons and Mirbel with fifteen
thousand men, where he would have been joined by all
the republicans from the south and from Burgundy. The
victorious Council would not have been more than three
or four days without coming to some violent rupture and
division: for it is known that, if the numbers of these
Councils were unanimous in their proceedings against the
Directory, they were far from being so as to the further
course they meant to pursue. The leaders, such as
Pichegru, Imbert-Colonnes, and others, sold to foreign
powers, exerted all their influence to restore royalty and
bring about a counter-revolution; whilst Carnot and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>others sought to produce results quite opposite to these.
France would therefore have become immediately a prey
to confusion and anarchy, and in that case, all factions
would have seen, with satisfaction, Napoleon appear as a
rallying point, an anchor of safety, capable of saving
them at the same time from the terror of royalty and
from the terror of demagogues. Napoleon would then
naturally have repaired to Paris, and found himself placed
at the head of affairs by the unanimous wish and consent
of all parties. The majority of the Councils was strong
and positive, it is true, but it was only against the Directors;
it would have been divided <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ad infinitum</em></span> as soon as
they were overturned.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The choice of three new Directors having openly exposed
the true intention of the measures of the counter-revolution,
the greatest number of the citizens, in their
alarm, were ready to fly to meet Napoleon with the
national oriflamme<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a> unfurled; for the true counter-revolutionists
were after all few in number, and their
pretensions were too ridiculous and absurd. Every
thing would have given way before Napoleon. Had they
called him Cæsar or Cromwell, still he would have
marched with a religion, a party, whose ideas were settled
and popular; he was master of his soldiers, the coffers of
the army were full, and he was in possession of every
other means calculated to ensure their constancy and
their fidelity. If the question were now to be asked
whether Napoleon, in the recesses of his own mind, would
or would not have wished affairs to take this turn, we
should give our opinion in the affirmative; and we are
led to believe from the following fact, that his wishes and
his hopes were in favour of the triumph of the majority
of the Councils. At the moment of the crisis between
the two factions, a secret decree, signed by the three
members composing the party of the Directory, asked
him for three millions to resist the attack of the Councils,
but Napoleon, under various pretences, did not send
them, although it would have been easy for him to do so;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>yet it is well known that it is not consistent with his
character to hesitate in money matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore, when the struggle was over, and the Directory
took pleasure in acknowledging openly that it
owed its existence to Napoleon, it still entertained some
vague suspicions that Napoleon had only espoused its
cause in the hopes of seeing it overthrown, and of
taking its place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be that as it may, after the 18th Fructidor, the enthusiasm
of the army was at its height, and the triumph
of Napoleon complete. But the Directory, notwithstanding
its apparent gratitude, surrounded Napoleon from
that moment with numerous agents, who watched his
motions and endeavoured to penetrate his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The situation of Napoleon was one of extreme delicacy,
although his conduct was so well regulated, and so
admirable, that even at this period we can only form
mere conjectures on the subject; but to the delicacy of
his situation it is that we think we can trace the principal
reasons which led to the conclusion of the peace at
Campo Formio, to his refusal to remain at the Congress
of Rastadt, and finally, to the undertaking of the
expedition to Egypt.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As it always happens in France, immediately after
the 18th Fructidor, the party that had been overthrown
disappeared on a sudden, and the majority of the Directory
triumphed without moderation. It became every
thing, and reduced the Councils to nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Napoleon then felt the necessity of peace, which,
putting an end to the present state of affairs, would increase
his popularity: he had every thing to fear from
the prolongation of war; it might furnish those who
should have suspected him ready pretexts for injuring
him; or the intention might be to expose him in situations
of difficulty, and unite the other generals against
him.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr267.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Two'>“Two</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_267.37'><ins class='correction' title='Two'>“Two</ins></a></span> of the generals, who enjoyed the greatest reputation
at that time, manifested openly their sentiments
with respect to the great affair of Fructidor: these were
Moreau and Hoche.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreau had declared himself positively against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Directory, and by a line of conduct at once pusillanimous
and culpable, he failed in his duty and compromised his
honour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hoche was entirely in favour of the Directory, impelled
by the impetuosity of his disposition, he marched
part of his army upon Paris, and failed by acting with too
much precipitation. His troops were countermanded by
the influence of the Councils, and he himself was obliged
to leave Paris, to avoid being arrested by order of these
Councils. Hoche had therefore done nothing to contribute
to the success of the 18th Fructidor; on the contrary
he had injured the cause by excess of zeal. But
he had shown himself a man entirely devoted to the Directory,
and the majority of them could rely on him
without reserve, although his imprudence had nearly
been the cause of their ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That same majority of the Directory entertained
doubts, on the contrary, with respect to Napoleon, who
had been the cause of their triumph; they still thought
it possible that the General of the army of Italy had calculated
that the Directory would fall in the contest with
the Councils, and that he might then rise upon its ruins.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But how could the Directory reconcile that supposition
with the acts of the General, who had done every
thing to ensure its triumph? for it is evident that without
the order of the day of Napoleon, and the address
to his army, the Directory would have been undone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some persons, well informed on the subject, seem
to think that Napoleon had really not formed a due estimate
of the influence which he exercised in France—that
he had suffered himself to be misled by the libels and the
newspapers in which he was attacked,—and that he had
considered the measures which he adopted calculated
not to ensure the complete triumph of the Directory, but
to produce precisely the effect of rendering him the deliverer
and the true support of the republic. The same
persons add that when the officers whom Napoleon had
at Paris, and letters from every part of France, had informed
him that his proclamation had in one moment
changed altogether the state of public feeling in the interior,
then, and then only, he saw that he had done too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>much. We are the more ready to adopt this opinion
as we cannot understand why Napoleon should have
thought of preserving three Directors whom he did not
care about. The only one he esteemed (Carnot) was of
the opposite party, and we know that he felt indignant
at the corruptness and the weakness of the others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A man named Bottot, a private agent of Barras,
was sent to Napoleon with secret instructions, to endeavour
to penetrate his views and to ascertain why he had
not sent the three millions of which the Directory had
stood so much in need. Bottot found the French General
at Passeriano, and began to intrigue right and left
with those who surrounded Napoleon; but he found
every one warmly attached to the party that had triumphed;
and, having some concerns of his own to arrange,
he at last, in the course of some private conversations,
confessed the secret of his mission and the vague
suspicions entertained by the Directory. He had been
soon undeceived by the appearance of simplicity which
distinguished Napoleon’s establishment, by the frankness
of Napoleon himself; and above all by the enthusiasm
of the army, and of the whole of Italy in favour of the
General. But, even if the suspicion of the Directory
had been well founded, it would not have been difficult,
with a few marks of attention, and some frank and unaffected
conversations, to remove from Bottot’s mind,
surrounded as he then was, all cause of umbrage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He wrote to Paris that the fears which had been entertained
were altogether groundless, and much less to
be dreaded than the perverseness of those who wished to
excite them. But the three millions, it was objected to
him, why were they refused? Napoleon had proved that
the order sent by the Directory was mysterious and irregular,
and that, encompassed as it was by such rogues
as F—— and others, who had already robbed the public
exchequer, he had thought it prudent to ascertain the
truth; that he had immediately dispatched Lavalette,
his confidential aid-de-camp, to Paris, and that, as soon
as Lavalette had informed him of the true state of affairs,
he was on the point of sending off the three millions,
when the fate of the day was decided.”</p>

  <h3 class='c006'>ENGLISH DIPLOMACY.—LORD WHITWORTH.—CHATHAM.—CASTLEREAGH.—CORNWALLIS.—FOX, &amp;C.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Monday, 10th—The course of our conversation to-day
led the Emperor to observe that nothing was so dangerous
and so treacherous as official conversations with
diplomatic agents of Great Britain. “The English
Ministers,” said he, “never represent an affair from
their nation to another, but as from themselves to their
own nation. They care little what their adversaries
have said or say; they boldly put forward what their
diplomatic agents have said, or what they make them
say, on the ground that, those agents having a public
and acknowledged character, faith must be placed in
their reports. It is in pursuance of this principle,
Napoleon added, that the English Ministers published at
the time, under the name of Lord Whitworth, a long
conversation between me and Whitworth, the account of
which was entirely false.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>That ambassador had solicited an audience of the
First Consul, and personal communications. The First
Consul, who was himself fond of treating affairs directly,
willingly assented. <a id='corr270.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='But'>“But</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_270.22'><ins class='correction' title='But'>“But</ins></a></span> this proved for me,” said the
Emperor, “a lesson which altered my method for ever.
From this moment, I never treated officially of political
affairs, but through the intervention of my minister for
Foreign affairs. He at any rate could give a positive
and formal denial; which the sovereign could not do.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is utterly false,” added the Emperor, "that any
thing occurred in the course of our personal interview,
which was not in conformity with the common rules of
decorum. Lord Whitworth himself, after our conference,
being in company with other Ambassadors, expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>himself perfectly satisfied, and added that he had no
doubt all things would be satisfactorily settled. But
what was the surprise of those same Ambassadors, when
they read a short time afterwards in the English newspapers
the report of Lord Whitworth, in which he
charged me with having behaved in the interview with
unbecoming violence! We had some warm friends
amongst these Ambassadors, and some of them went so
far as to express their surprise to the English diplomatist,
observing to him that his report was very different from
what he had said to them immediately after the conference.
Lord Whitworth made the best excuse he
could, but persisted in maintaining the assertions of the
official document.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact is,” said the Emperor, “that every political
agent of Great Britain is in the habit of making two
reports on the same subject; one public and false for the
ministerial archives, the other confidential and true for
the Ministers themselves, and for them alone; and when
the responsibility of Ministers is at stake, they produce
the first of these documents, which, although false,
answers every purpose, and serves to exonerate them.
And thus it is,” added the Emperor, "that the best
institutions become vicious, when they are no longer
founded on morality, and when their agents are only
actuated by selfishness, pride, and insolence. Absolute
power has no need of disguise; it is silent: responsible
governments, being obliged to speak, have recourse to
artifice, and lie with effrontery.</p>

<p class='c001'>"It is, however, a circumstance worthy of remark,
that, in my great struggle with England, the government
of that country has constantly contrived to attach
so much odium to my person and actions; and that they
have so impudently exclaimed against my despotism, my
selfishness, my ambition, and my perfidy, when they
alone were guilty of all they dared to lay to my charge.
A very strong prejudice must have existed against me, I
must have been indeed very much to be feared, since
people could suffer themselves to be thus deceived. I
can understand it from Kings and Cabinets, their existence
was at stake; but from the people!!...</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>"The British Ministers spoke incessantly of my
duplicity; but could any thing be compared to their
Machiavelism, their selfishness, during the existence of
disorders and convulsions, which were kept alive by
them?</p>

<p class='c001'>"They sacrificed unfortunate Austria in 1805, merely
to escape the invasion with which I threatened them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"They sacrificed her again in 1809, to be more at
liberty to act in the Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c001'>"They sacrificed Prussia in 1806, in the hopes of
recovering Hanover.</p>

<p class='c001'>"They did not assist Russia in 1807, because they
chose rather to seize distant colonies, and because they
were attempting to take possession of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c001'>"They gave to the world the infamous spectacle of
bombarding Copenhagen in time of peace, and lying in
ambush to steal the Danish fleet. They had already
once before exhibited a similar spectacle by seizing, like
highway robbers, also in time of peace, four Spanish
frigates laden with rich treasures.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Lastly, during the war in the Peninsula, where they
endeavoured to prolong the existence of anarchy and
confusion, their principal object was to traffic with the
wants and the blood of the Spanish nation, by obliging
it to purchase their services and their supplies at the
expense of gold and concessions.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Whilst all Europe, through their intrigues and their
subsidies, was bathed in blood, they were only intent
upon providing for their own safety, gaining advantages
for their trade, and obtaining the sovereignty of the sea
and the monopoly of the world. As for myself, I had
never done any thing of the kind, and, until the unfortunate
business with Spain, which after all is not to be
compared with the affair of Copenhagen, I can say that
my morality was unimpeachable. My actions had perhaps
been dictatorial and peremptory, but never disgraced
by perfidy. Who can be surprised, after all this, if, in
1814, although England had really been the deliverer of
Europe, not a single Englishman could show himself on
the Continent without meeting at every step with maledictions,
hatred, and execrations? Who can ask how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>this happened? Every tree bears its own fruit; we reap
only what we have sown; and such was necessarily
the infallible result of the misdeeds of the English
Government, the tyranny and the insolence of the
Ministers in London, and of their agents all over the
globe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"For the last fifty years the administrations of Great
Britain have gradually declined in consideration and in
public estimation. Formerly, the struggle for power was
between great national parties, characterised by grand
and distinct systems; but now we see only the bickerings
of one and the same oligarchy, having constantly
the same object in view, and whose discordant members
adjust their differences by compromise and concessions:
they have turned the Cabinet of St. James’s into a shop.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The policy of Lord Chatham was marked by acts of
injustice, no doubt; but at least he proclaimed them
with boldness and energy; they had a certain air of
grandeur. Pitt introduced into the Cabinet a system of
hypocrisy and dissimulation. Lord Castlereagh, the
self-styled heir of Pitt, has brought into it the extreme
of every kind of turpitude and immorality. Chatham
gloried in being a merchant; Lord Castlereagh, to the
serious injury of his nation, has indulged himself in the
satisfaction of acting the <em>fine gentleman</em>; he has sacrificed
his country to fraternise with the great people of
the continent, and from that moment has united in his
person the vices of the saloon with the cupidity of the
counting-house; the duplicity and obsequiousness of the
courtier with the haughtiness and insolence of the
upstart. The poor English constitution is in imminent
danger. What a difference between such men and the
Foxes, the Sheridans, and the Greys, those splendid
talents, those noble characters of the Opposition, who
have been the objects of the ridicule of a victorious
oligarchy!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord Cornwallis,” said the Emperor, "is the first
Englishman who gave me, in good earnest, a favourable
opinion of his nation; after him Fox, and I might add
to these, if it were necessary, our present Admiral
(Malcolm).</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>"Cornwallis was, in every sense of the word, a
worthy, good, and honest man. At the time of the
treaty of Amiens, the terms having been agreed upon, he
had promised to sign the next day at a certain hour;
something of consequence detained him at home, but he
pledged his word. The evening of that same day, a
courier arrived from London proscribing certain articles
of the treaty, but he answered that he had signed, and
immediately came and actually signed. We understood
each other perfectly well; I had placed a regiment at
his disposal, and he took pleasure in seeing its man&oelig;uvres.
I have preserved an agreeable recollection of
him in every respect, and it is certain that a request
from him would have had more weight with me, perhaps,
than one from a crowned head. His family appears to
have guessed this to be the case; some requests have
been made to me in its name, which have all been
granted.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Fox came to France immediately after the peace of
Amiens. He was employed in writing a history of the
Stuarts, and asked my permission to search our diplomatic
archives. I gave orders that every thing should
be placed at his disposal. I received him often. Fame
had informed me of his talents, and I soon found that he
possessed a noble character, a good heart, liberal, generous,
and enlightened views. I considered him an
ornament to mankind, and was very much attached to
him. We often conversed together upon various topics,
without the least prejudice; when I wished to engage in
a little controversy, I turned the conversation upon the
subject of the infernal machine; and told him that his
ministers had attempted to murder me; he would then
oppose my opinion with warmth, and invariably ended
the conversation by saying, in his bad French, ‘First
Consul, pray take that out of your head.’ But he was
not convinced of the truth of the cause he undertook to
advocate, and there is every reason to believe that he
argued more in defence of his country, than of the
morality of its ministers."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor ended the conversation, by saying:
“Half a dozen such men as Fox and Cornwallis would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>be sufficient to establish the moral character of a nation....
With such men I should always have agreed;
we should soon have settled our differences, and not
only France would have been at peace with a nation at
bottom most worthy of esteem, but we should have done
great things together.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HISTORY OF THE CONVENTION BY LACRETELLE.—STATISTICAL NOTICE OF THE OXEN OF THE ISLAND.—PUNS.—STATISTICS IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Tuesday, 11th.—This has been one of those days of
wind and rain so common here. The Emperor, about
three o’clock, took advantage of a short interval to visit
the garden. He sent for me; he had just been reading
the history of the Convention by Lacretelle. It is, he
observed, certainly not ill-written; but it is ill-digested,
and makes no impression on the memory; the whole is
a smooth surface without a single asperity to arrest attention.
He does not thoroughly examine his subject:
he has not done justice to many celebrated characters;
he gives no adequate colouring to the crimes of several
others, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rain obliged us to return, and we walked alone
for a long time in the saloon and the dining room.</p>

<p class='c001'>We had been informed, that there were four thousand
oxen in the island, and that the annual consumption consisted
of five hundred, of which number one hundred and
fifty were appropriated to us, fifty to the colony, and
three hundred to the shipping. It was added, that four
years were requisite for the reproduction of the stock,
and this formed a subject for our calculations; an employment
for which the Emperor’s peculiar taste is well
known.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subsistence and consumption of these oxen are an
important affair in the island. A single beast cannot be
killed without the previous order of the governor, and
it was stated by one of our people, that the owner of one
of the houses or huts of the island, speaking to him on
the subject, said: “It is reported, that you complain up
yonder, and consider yourselves badly off; (he spoke of
Longwood) but we are at a loss to make it out; for it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>said that you have beef every day, while we cannot get
it but three or four times a year, and even then we pay
for it at the rate of fifteen or twenty pence a pound.”
The Emperor, who laughed heartily at the story, observed,
“You ought to have assured him, that it cost us
more than a crown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I observed some time afterwards, that it was the only
pun I had till then heard from the Emperor’s mouth, but
the person to whom I made the remark, said he had heard
of his having made a similar one, and on the same subject,
in the isle of Elba. A mason employed in some
buildings, which were to be constructed by the Emperor’s
order, had fallen and hurt himself; the Emperor wishing
to encourage him, assured him, that it would be of no
consequence. “I have had,” said he, “a much worse
fall than yours; but look at me, I am on my legs, and
hearty, for all that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor’s attention was for a moment directed to
political statistics. He highly extolled the progress and
utility of that new science, so well adapted, he observed,
to point out the path of truth, to establish and confirm
opinions. He called it the <em>budget of things</em>, and “without
budget,” said he gaily, “there is no safety.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The singular application of the science by an Englishman
or German, who had the patience and resolution to
ascertain the number of times each letter of the alphabet
occurred in the Bible, was then noticed by a person present.
He also mentioned another application of it, less
dull, but not less singular. It was that made by a German,
eighty years of age, who amused himself with <a id='corr276.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='calcuating'>calculating</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_276.30'><ins class='correction' title='calcuating'>calculating</ins></a></span>
what he might have eaten, during his life, in beef,
mutton, poultry, vegetables, &amp;c. as well as what he had
drunk. The estimate comprehended immense droves,
flocks, and accumulations of all sorts. The public market-place
was incapable of containing all he had devoured.
This minute applicant of the science did not stop there.
He had the curiosity to inquire how often he might have
again swallowed the same things. For, he judiciously
observed, their transmutation in his person ought necessarily
to have contributed to their reproduction. The
Emperor laughed much at the calculation, and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>particularly at the whimsical repetition of the same
eatables.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CHARACTERS. BAILLI, LAFAYETTE, MONGES, GRÉGOIRE, &amp;C.—ST. DOMINGO.—SYSTEM TO BE FOLLOWED.—DICTATIONS ON THE CONVENTION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>June 12th.—We have had three days of horrible weather,
when a moment that promised to continue fine,
induced the Emperor to take an airing in his carriage.
He had just finished reading the History of the Constituent
Assembly, by Rabeau de St. Etienne. He entertained
very nearly the same opinion of this writer as of
Lacretelle. He then took occasion to notice several
characters.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bailli,” he said, “was not a bad man, but unquestionably
a miserable politician. Lafayette was another
simpleton, and by no means formed for the eminent character
he wished to represent. His political simplicity was
such, that he could not avoid being the constant dupe of
men and things. His breaking up of the chambers on
my return from Waterloo, was my ruin. Who could
have persuaded him, that I had arrived merely for the
purpose of dissolving them;—I, whose only safety was
centred in them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the party saying, by way of excuse or extenuation;
“It was, however, sire, the same man, who,
treating afterwards with the allies, was filled with indignation
at their proposal of delivering up your Majesty,
and eagerly asked, if it was to the prisoner of Olmutz
they dared to address themselves?”—"But, sir," replied
the Emperor, “you run from one subject to another, or
rather, you concur with, instead of opposing, my opinion.
I have not attacked the sentiments or intentions of M.
de Lafayette; I have only complained of their fatal
results.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor then continued, in the same way, to review
the leading men of that period. He dwelt at considerable
length on the affair of Favras, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For the rest,” observed the Emperor, "nothing was
more common than to find men of that epoch quite the
reverse in character of that which their words and actions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>seemed to establish. Monges, for instance, might
be considered a terrible man. When war was resolved
upon, he declared from the tribune of the Jacobins, that
he would give his two daughters in marriage to the two
first soldiers who might be wounded by the enemy. This
he was at liberty to do, in the strict sense of the gift, as
far as it respected himself; but he maintained, that
others should be compelled to follow his example, and
that all the nobility should be put to death, &amp;c. Yet
Monges was one of the mildest and weakest men living,
and would not have suffered a chicken to be killed, if he
had been obliged to do it himself or to see it done. This
furious republican, as he believed himself, cherished,
however, a kind of worship for me, which he pushed to
adoration. He loved me, as a man loves his mistress.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Grégoire, whose animosity to the clergy, whom he
wished to bring back to their original simplicity, was so
great that he might have passed for a champion of irreligion,
may be mentioned as another instance; yet
Grégoire, when the revolutionists were denying their God,
and abolishing the priesthood, was very near being massacred
in mounting the tribune, for the purpose of
boldly declaring his religious sentiments, and protesting
that he would die a priest. At the very moment when
the work of destruction was going on in all the churches
against the altars, Grégoire erected one in his own apartment,
and said mass there every day. This man’s lot,
however, is decidedly cast. If he be driven from France,
he must take refuge in St. Domingo. The friend, the
advocate, the eulogist of the negroes will be a god, or a
saint, among them."</p>

<p class='c001'>St. Domingo naturally became the next subject of our
conversation. I had, in my younger days, seen that
colony in its most flourishing state. The Emperor put
many questions to me, and made himself acquainted
with all the circumstances relating to that remote period.
When his enquiries were over, he said, “I shall, no
doubt, astonish you: but I am convinced, even from
your own statements, that the island has not, at this moment,
lost a third, certainly not one half of its value,
and that, in a short time, it will recover all its former
prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>I should not, in reality, be surprised at it; for all the
absurd stories, circulated in Europe respecting France,
ought to put us on our guard against those which might
be safely told with regard to St. Domingo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said that, after the restoration, the
French government had sent out emissaries and proposals
which were laughed at by the negroes. “As to myself,”
he added, “on my return from Elba, I would have settled
all differences with them; I would have recognized
their independence, contented myself with some factories,
like those on the coast of Africa, endeavoured to draw
them closer to the mother country, and to establish a
kind of family intercourse with them, which might, in
my opinion, have been easily accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have to reproach myself with the attempt made
upon the colony during the consulship. The design of
reducing it by force was a great error. I ought to have
been satisfied with governing it through the medium of
Toussaint. Peace with England was not sufficiently
consolidated, and the territorial wealth I should have
acquired by its reduction would have served but to enrich
our enemies.” He had, he observed, the greater
reason to reproach himself with this fault, because he
had foreseen its failure, and it was executed against his
inclination. He had solely yielded to the opinion of the
council of state and his ministers, hurried along, as they
were by the clamours of the colonists, who formed a
considerable party at Paris, and were, besides, he said,
either nearly all royalists or in the pay of the English
faction.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor assured us, that the army which had
been sent out consisted but of sixteen thousand men,
and was quite sufficient. The failure of the expedition
was solely to be attributed to accidental circumstances,
such as the yellow fever, the death of the Commander-in-chief,
but above all to his blunders, a new war, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The arrival of the Captain General Leclere,” said
the Emperor, "was followed by complete success, but he
had not the skill to ensure its continuance. Had he
followed the secret instructions which I drew up for him
myself, he would have saved many lives and spared himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>great mortifications. I ordered him, among other
things, to associate with himself men of colour, that he
might the better keep the Blacks in subjection; and, as
soon as he had reduced the Colony, to send to France all
the black Generals and superior officers, to be placed at
the disposal of the minister at war, who would have
employed them in their respective ranks. This measure,
which would have deprived the Negro population of its
chiefs and its leaders, would have been a decisive stroke,
without wounding in their persons the military laws and
regulations. But Leclere did just the contrary: he kept
down the people of colour, and bestowed his confidence
on the black Generals. In consequence, as it might naturally
be expected, he was duped by the latter, found
himself beset with difficulties, and the Colony was lost.
At first, he would not send to France Toussaint, who
had filled a distinguished post there; but after some
time he found himself obliged to order his apprehension
and to send him prisoner to us. Malevolence did
not fail to paint this act under the odious colours of
tyranny and perfidy, representing Toussaint as an innocent
victim deserving of the deepest interest; and yet he
was eminently criminal.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Toussaint was not a man destitute of merit; though
certainly he was not what people attempted to describe
him at the time. His character, besides, was ill calculated
to inspire real confidence; he had given us
serious causes of complaint. We must always have
distrusted him.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a> He was chiefly guided by an officer of
engineers or artillery, director of the fortifications of
St. Domingo. (Colonel Vincent). That officer had
come to France before Leclere’s expedition, and conferences
were, for a long time, held with him. He exerted
himself very much to prevent the attempt, and described
with great precision, all its difficulties, without pretending,
however, that it was impossible." The Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>thought that the Bourbons might succeed in
reducing St. Domingo if they employed force; but on
that subject the result of arms was not to be calculated
upon; it was rather the result of commerce and of grand
political views. Three or four hundred millions of
capital transferred from France to a remote country;
an indefinite period for reaping the fruits of such a
sacrifice; the very great certainty of seeing them engrossed
by the English, or swallowed up by revolutions,
&amp;c.: those were the points for consideration. The
Emperor concluded with saying, "The colonial system,
which we have witnessed, is closed for us, as well as
for the whole continent of Europe; we must give it up,
and henceforth confine ourselves to the free navigation
of the seas, and the complete liberty of universal <a id='corr281.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='exchange.'>exchange.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_281.15'><ins class='correction' title='exchange.'>exchange.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>The History of the Convention, of which Napoleon
had already expressed his disapprobation, again presented
itself to his thoughts; he was far from being
satisfied with Lacretelle. “Sentences in abundance,”
he repeated, “and but little colouring, no depth: he is
an academician, but in no respect a historian.” He
made me call my son, and dictated the two following
notes, of which I give a literal copy, however imperfect
they may be, for he never read them a second time.
Every thing that comes from him is, in my opinion,
valuable.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>NOTE I.</h3>

<p class='c007'>"The Convention, called by a law of the Legislative
Assembly to give a new constitution to France, decreed
the Republic; not that the most enlightened did not
think the republican system incompatible with the existing
state of manners in France, but because the Monarchy
could not be continued without placing the Duke
of Orleans on the throne, which would have alienated a
great part of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>"An executive power, consisting of five ministers,
was established by the Convention for conducting the
affairs of the republic.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Two parties contended for the ascendancy in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>National Convention: that of the <em>Girondists</em>, composed
of men who had influenced the Legislative Assembly,
and that of the <em>Mountain</em>, formed by the Commune of
Paris, which had directed the atrocities of the 10th of
August and the 2d of September, and commanded the
population of the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Vergniaud, Brissot, Condorcet, Guadet, and Roland,
were the leaders of the Girondists; Danton, Robespierre,
Marat, Collot d’Herbois, and Billaud-Varennes, headed
the Mountain. These two parties were alike indebted
for their rise to the principles of the revolution. Their
conductors sprang out of the popular societies which they
had successively rendered subservient to their views.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The party of the Girondists was more powerful in
talents, and was eminently popular in the great provincial
towns, particularly at Bourdeaux, Montpellier, Marseilles,
Caen, Lyons, &amp;:c.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The party of the Mountain possessed more energy
and enthusiasm, and was not less popular in the capital
and among the clubs of the departments.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondist party, which, in the Legislative
Assembly, had been the most ardent for the Revolution,
became, in the Convention, the most moderate; because
it had to contend there with a faction much more violent
than itself, which had not found its way into the
Assembly.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondists called their adversaries the faction of
September, and constantly reproached them with the
horrible massacre of which they were guilty. They accused
them of being hostile to a national assembly, and
of endeavouring to transfer the government of France to
the Commune of Paris; but by these means the Girondists
only excited against themselves the Jacobins of all
the departments.</p>

<p class='c001'>"On its side, the Commune of Paris (the Mountaineers)
stigmatized the Girondists by the name of the
federalists, and charged them with the design of establishing
a federative system in France similar to that of
Switzerland. They also accused them of endeavouring to
stir up the provinces against the capital, and thus held
them up to the detestation of the people of Paris, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>could maintain its splendour only by the union and unity
of the whole of the territory. When the Girondists
inveighed against the Mountaineers for the massacres of
the 2nd of September, the latter reproached the former
with having, during the Legislative Assembly, rashly
and without cause, declared war against all Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondists, at first, appeared to have the upper
hand in the Convention, and they directed that Marat
should be brought to trial, and that proceedings should
be instituted against the assassins of September. But
Marat, supported by the Jacobins and the Commune of
Paris, was acquitted by the revolutionary tribunal, and
returned in triumph to the bosom of the assembly.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The trial of the King had been another apple of discord.
The two parties seemed to proceed in unison, and
voted, it is true, for his death; but the greater part of
the Girondists also voted for an appeal to the people;
and here it is difficult to comprehend the reason of their
conduct during that crisis. If they wished to save the
king, they were at liberty to do so; they had only to
vote for deportation, exile, or the adjournment of the
question; but to sentence him to death and make his
fate depend upon the will of the people, was, in the
highest degree, absurd and impolitic. They seemed to be
desirous, that after the extinction of the monarchy,
France should be torn to pieces by civil war.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The general opinion ever since the commencement
of the revolution, that the most audacious and unreasonable
faction would always predominate, was from that
moment verified. The Girondists, however, maintained
the contest with courage, and very often had majorities
in the assembly during all the months of March, April,
and May. But the party of the Mountaineers had recourse,
in these circumstances, to an expedient which it
had constantly employed. On the 31st of May, the fate
of the Girondists was decided by an insurrection of the
sections of Paris. Twenty-seven were arrested, brought
before the revolutionary tribunal, and sentenced to death;
seventy-three were thrown into prison, and from that
period the triumphant Mountain had no obstacles to encounter
in the Convention. Several Girondist deputies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>took refuge, however, at Caen, and there raised the
standard of insurrection. Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux,
Montpellier, and several towns of Brittany, embraced
cause of this party, and also took up arms against the
the Convention.</p>

<p class='c001'>"All these unconnected efforts were of no avail against
the capital, and the Mountain remained in tranquil
possession of the national tribune. A circumstance altogether
singular contributed to confirm the preponderance
of Paris. It was the assignats, then the only resource
for supplying the treasury; not a single tax was then
paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The provinces learnt with considerable emotion the
event of the 31st of May, and the death of the most
celebrated of the Girondist party. The armies were not
agitated by these results; they took no share in the
insurrections of some provinces, and remained all attached
to the Convention and the dominant party at Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>"When the partial insurrection of certain towns in
favour of the Girondists was known, all the armies had
already taken the oath and testified their adhesion to the
Mountain; besides, in the eyes of Frenchmen, Paris was
France. Neither did the departments of Alsace, la Moselle,
Flanders, Franche Comté, and Dauphiné, where
the principal forces of the republic were quartered, sympathize
in the feelings of the federalist towns.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The 31st of May deprived France of men of great
talents, zealously attached to liberty, and the principles
of the revolution. The catastrophe might afflict the
well disposed, but could not surprise them. It was impossible
for an assembly, which had extricated France
from the critical situation to which she was reduced, to
carry on public business with two parties so inveterately
and irreconcileably opposed. It was necessary for the
safety of the republic that one should extinguish the
other, and there can be no doubt that, had the Girondists
obtained the victory, they would have consigned their
adversaries to the scaffold.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Emperor, who had dictated in his usual way,
from memory alone, without any research, whether he
was dissatisfied with the task he had executed, or for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>some other reason, stopped short, for the purpose, as
he said, of recommencing a new dictation on the same
subject.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>NOTE II.</h3>

<p class='c007'>"The Convention was established in September, 1792,
and terminated in October, 1795, Its reign, which
lasted nearly three years, presents four eras.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The 1st, from its commencement to the 31st of
May 1793—epoch of the destruction of the Girondists.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The 2nd, to March 1794—overthrow of the Commune
of Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The 3rd, to July, 1794—fall of Robespierre.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The 4th to the 14th Vendémiaire (4th October,
1795)—installation of the Government of the Directory.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Its <em>first era</em> consisted of eight months, its second
of ten, its third of four, its fourth of fourteen. Total,
three years.</p>

<p class='c001'>"During its first era the Convention was constantly
divided between the parties of the Mountain and the
Gironde.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Danton, Robespierre, Marat, Collot-d’Herbois, Billaud-Varennes,
Carnot, Heraut de Sechelles, were the
leaders of the party of the Mountain.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Brissot, Condorcet, <a id='corr285.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Verginaud'>Vergniaud</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_285.24'><ins class='correction' title='Verginaud'>Vergniaud</ins></a></span>, Gaudet, Gensonnè,
Péthion, Lasource, Barbaroux, headed the party of the
Gironde.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The two parties were equally hostile to the Bourbons
and the royalists.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The men of the first were distinguished for superior
energy, those of the second for superior talents. They
were both the partisans of a republican establishment.
The Mountaineers were desirous of a Republic, for the
purpose of destroying what was in existence before the
Revolution, both men and things. The Girondists were
animated by the infatuation of youthful feeling, which
presented at once Athens and Rome to their view, and
revived recollections of sublime antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The existence of the mountaineers may be dated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>from the time of the Constituent Assembly. They were
the firebrands of the clubs so generally known by the
name of Jacobin. The insurrection of the Field of Mars
was planned by them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"This party did not obtain admission into the Constituent
and Legislative Assemblies.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondists, who predominated in the legislative,
were hostile to the Constitution of 1794 and to the
King. They would not undertake his defence, and suffered
him to be sacrificed to the efforts of the Mountain,
which, however, was also their enemy. It was the Mountaineers
who caused the atrocities of the 20th of June,
of the 10th of August, and of the 2nd of September;
they had then no party in the assembly; but they compelled
the Girondists to join them after their victory.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The <em>first era</em> of the Convention presents the struggle
of the Girondists and Mountaineers; the Girondists
prevailed at that time in consequence of their superior
talents, their eloquence, and their already acquired reputation.
The presidents were nearly all Girondists; they
charged the Mountain with the design of destroying the
National Assembly, and substituting in its place a Parisian
Dictatorship. They also reproached it with the
massacre of September.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Mountain, in its turn, charged them with wishing
for a federative republic like Switzerland, with being
hostile to the capital, and with having, without cause,
placed the republic in a state of warfare with the whole
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Mountain had at its command the Jacobins of
Paris, and the greatest part of the popular societies of
the republic; the commune of Paris, the sections, the
revolutionary tribunal, and the lower classes of the people
of the capital were devoted to its interests.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondists possessed great influence over the
departments in general and the enlightened part of the
nation; their partizans were more numerous among the
upper class of society. The Girondists, who had occupied
the left side in the Legislative Assembly, and had
shewn such animosity against the King, the ministers,
and the right side, or moderate party, were forced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>shift places, and become in their turn the right side or
moderate party, opposed to the vehement and overbearing
Mountain, which henceforth formed the left
side.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Mountaineers, working on the plan they had
adopted under the Constituent Assembly, enlisted all the
passions in their service, and demanded, with loud cries,
the death of the King. The Girondists might, by openly
defending him, have preserved his life; they had recourse
to the singular system of condemning him, and, after
having thus destroyed the monarchy, they wished the
sentence to be confirmed by an appeal to the people:
in other words, they wished to destroy France by the
horrors of a civil war. This false combination ruined
them.—Vergniaud, one of the pillars of their party, proclaimed
the sentence of death passed upon the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Girondists were so powerful in the Assembly,
that several months’ labour and several days’ insurrection
were necessary to destroy their influence in the
Convention.</p>

<p class='c001'>"This party would have governed the Convention and
crushed the Mountain, had its system of conduct been
more direct and candid. The metaphysicians had too
weighty a preponderance in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The <em>second era</em> of the Convention is the reign of
the Mountain. Twenty-two of the principal Girondists
perished on the scaffold, or fell by their own hands;
seventy-three were thrown into prison. The Mountain,
ruled with absolute power; it created the revolutionary
government, and the Convention in a mass placed itself,
of its own accord, under the yoke of the Committee of
Public Safety and of the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p class='c001'>"In this second era, the sittings of the Convention
no longer resembled those of the first; there was an end
of discussion and of liberty; it was the despotism of the
Decemvirs. Some of the Deputies governed the Committees
of General Security, of Finance, &amp;c. Others
were dispatched by the Committee of Public Safety to
the Armies and the Departments, and became real Pro-consuls.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Every month, every week, every day, the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>became more ferocious and sanguinary. All <a id='corr288.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thos,'>those,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_288.1'><ins class='correction' title='thos,'>those,</ins></a></span>
in the higher classes of society who had not emigrated
were crowded together in the prisons, as objects of suspicion,
and sent by hundreds to the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c001'>"After treating in this way every one who was of a
noble family, a priest, a merchant, or a considerable proprietor,
the excesses of the party recoiling upon itself, it
ruled the Jacobins and the Commune of Paris with an
iron hand: it enslaved the Convention, and threatened
it with absolute annihilation; it preached up Atheism,
and proscribed the arts, the sciences, and every species
of talent. The artists and men of science were thrown
into prison, as objects of suspicion, and there was a time
when the National Library and the Garden of Plants
were on the point of being burnt and laid waste.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Robespierre and Danton, filled with indignation at
these outrages, united their efforts to put a stop to the
frightful progress of the popular madness. The capuchin
Chabot, Bazire, Fabre d’Eglantine, Hebert, Chaumet,
Vincent, and all their associates perished on the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c001'>"For the first time since the commencement of the
Revolution, the people saw persons put to death as ultra-revolutionary,
and no longer as having wished to stop
the Revolution. Their ideas were turned up-side down,
and underwent a real revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The prisons were filled with sans-culottes, and with
all that was basest in society. It was remarked, that the
apostate priests were numerous in that class.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The people beheld, without surprise and with joy,
the punishment of those who had until then governed
them, and that feeling was a revolution, which escaped
the observation of Robespierre and Danton, and which
they knew not how to convert to their advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The <em>third era</em> presents a spectacle different from
the other two. Danton and Robespierre had without
effort stopped the Revolution, and put a period to the
power of the Commune of Paris; but after their success
they fell out between themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Danton, Camille des Moulins, Heraut de Sechelles,
and Lacroix, were desirous of going a step farther, and
putting an end to the assassinations of the Revolutionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Tribunal. Danton and Lacroix had enriched themselves
in their mission to Belgium. Camille des Moulins,
who, from the beginning of the Revolution had given
himself the title of the Attorney-General of the Lantern,
was captivated and softened down by a young wife.
They had the boldness to demand, that the blow which
had been just struck against Hebert, or the rest of
Marat’s party, should be turned to the benefit of the
whole Republic—that no innocent person should in future
be condemned—that the system of terror should be
abolished—and that a Committee of Clemency should
be established.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Billaud-Varennes and Collot-d’Herbois, who took
the lead in the Committee of Public Safety and among
the great body of Jacobins, rejected these demands with
indignation and fury; and Robespierre, after some hesitation,
did not dare to support Danton, and made a
sacrifice of him. Danton, Camille des Moulins, Heraut
de Sechelles, &amp;c. perished on the scaffold, to which they
were dragged by the whole Committee of Public Safety,
and by the enraged Jacobins. The people were struck
with consternation, and for the first time expressed no
sign of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>"What Robespierre, however, had not dared to do,
and what he could have easily effected had he supported
Danton, he had the presumption to undertake after the
death of Danton. In order to put a period to Atheism,
he caused the existence of God to be proclaimed, and
he endeavoured to reinstate the virtues, the sciences,
and the arts. Billaud-Varennes, Collot-d’Herbois,
and Barrere, were struck with horror at seeing the termination
of the revolutionary government. They formed
a coalition with all the representatives, who, in their
missions, had caused the effusion of human blood, and
with all the numerous friends whom Danton had in the
Convention, such as Tallien, Fréron, Legendre; and
when Robespierre was bold enough to give a glimpse of
his plan for suppressing the administration of the pro-consuls,
and for the necessity of bringing to justice the
base characters, who had rendered the Revolution odious
in the provinces, he was consigned to the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>"The transactions of the 9th Thermidor constituted,
in reality, the triumph of Collot-d’Herbois and Billaud-Varennes,
men more horrible and bloodthirsty than
Robespierre; but that victory could not be obtained
over the Jacobins and the commune, without calling into
action the whole of the citizens; so that, with respect to
the middling classes and the people, the death of Robespierre
was the death of the revolutionary government;
and after various oscillations, those who wished to continue
the system of terror and had sacrificed Robespierre,
as he had sacrificed Danton, because he was desirous of
softening down and moderating the revolution, found
themselves drawn along with, and overpowered by, the
public opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“During the last ten months, Robespierre frequently
complained that he was rendered odious by having all
the massacres, which were perpetrated, attributed to him.
The men who caused his destruction were more sanguinary
and dreadful than he, but the whole nation,
which had for a long time imputed all the assassinations
to Robespierre, exclaimed that it was a triumph over
tyranny, and that belief put an end to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the dictation ended; the Emperor joined in
common conversation, and as he never resumed it, we
are deprived of the fourth era.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE MONITEUR AND LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>June 13th.—The Emperor had just run over a great
many numbers of the Moniteur. “These Moniteurs,”
said he, “so terrible and dangerous to so many reputations,
are uniformly useful and favourable to me alone.
It is with official documents that men of sense and real
talents will write history; now, these documents are full
of the spirit of my government, and to them I make an
earnest and solemn appeal.” He added, that he had
made the Moniteur the soul and life-blood of his government,
and that it was the intermediate instrument of his
communications with public opinion, both abroad and
at home. Every government had since followed his
example more or less in that respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whatever serious fault might be committed by any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of the high functionaries employed in the interior, immediately,”
said the Emperor, "an enquiry was set on
foot by three Councillors of State. They made their
report to me, confirmed the facts and discussed the
principles. For my own part, I had nothing more to do
than to write at the bottom—‘<em>Dispatched for execution
according to the laws of the republic, or of the empire.</em>’
My interference was at an end, the public result accomplished,
and popular opinion did justice to the transaction.
It was the most formidable and dreadful of my
tribunals. Did any question arise abroad respecting
certain grand political combinations or some delicate
points of diplomacy? The objects were indirectly hinted
at in the Moniteur. They instantly attracted universal
attention and became the topics of general investigation.
This conduct was at once the orderly signal for the adherents
of the throne, and at the same time an appeal to
the opinion of all. The Moniteur has been reproached
for the acrimony and virulence of its notes against the
enemy. But before we condemn them, we are bound to
take into consideration the benefits they may have produced,
the anxiety with which they occasionally gave the
enemy, the terror with which they struck a hesitating
cabinet, the stimulus which they imparted to our allies,
the confidence and audacity with which they inspired
our troops," &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation next turned upon the liberty of the
press, and the Emperor asked our opinions. We talked
for a long time very idly on the subject, and threw out
a great number of common-place ideas. Some were
hostile to it. “Nothing,” said they, “can resist the
liberty of the press. It is capable of overthrowing
every government, of agitating every society, of destroying
every reputation.” “It is only,” observed others, “its
prohibition that is dangerous. If it be restricted, it
becomes a mine that must explode, but if left to itself it
is merely an unbent bow, that can inflict no wound.”
Here the Emperor observed, that he was far from being
convinced with regard to that point, but that it was no
longer the question for consideration; that there were
institutions at present, and the liberty of the press was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>among the number, on the excellence of which we were
no longer called upon to decide, but solely to determine
the possibility of withholding them from the overbearing
influence of popular opinion. He declared, that the
prohibition under a representative government was a
gross anachronism, a downright absurdity. He had,
therefore, on his return from the Isle of Elba, abandoned
the press to all its excesses, and he was well assured,
that they had, in no respect, contributed to his recent
downfall. When it was proposed in council, in his
presence, to discuss the means of sheltering the authority
of the State from its attacks, he jocosely remarked,
“Gentlemen, it is probably yourselves you wish to protect,
for, with respect to me, I shall henceforth continue
a stranger to all such proceedings. The press has
exhausted itself upon me during my absence, and I
now defy it to produce any thing new or provoking
against me.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE WAR, AND ROYAL FAMILY OF SPAIN.—FERDINAND AT VALENCEY.—ERRORS IN THE AFFAIRS OF SPAIN.—HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THESE EVENTS, &amp;C.—NAPOLEON’S ADMIRABLE LETTER TO MURAT.</h3>

<p class='c007'>June 14th.—The Emperor had been ill the whole of
the night, and continued so during the day; he had a
foot-bath, and was not inclined to go out; he dined
alone in his apartment, and sent for me towards the
evening.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor began the conversation, of which the
constant subject was the Spanish war. It has been seen
in the notice which I have already taken of it, that the
Emperor took upon himself the whole blame of the measure.
I wish to avoid repetitions as much as possible,
and shall, therefore, allude to those topics only which
appeared new to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The old King and Queen,” said the Emperor, "at
the moment of the event, were the objects of the hatred
and contempt of their subjects. The Prince of Asturias
conspired against them, forced them to abdicate, and at
once united in his own person the love and hopes of the
nation. That nation was, however, ripe for great changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and demanded them with energy. I enjoyed vast popularity
in the country, and it was in that state of things
that all these personages met at Bayonne; the old king
calling upon me for vengeance against his son, and the
young prince soliciting my protection against his father,
and imploring a wife at my hands. I resolved to convert
this singular occasion to my advantage, with the
view of delivering myself from that branch of the Bourbons,
of continuing in my own dynasty the family system
of Louis XIV. and of binding Spain to the destinies of
France. Ferdinand was sent to Valencey, the old king
to Marseilles, as he wished, and my brother Joseph went
to reign at Madrid with a liberal constitution, adopted
by a junta of the Spanish nation, which had come to
receive it at Bayonne.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me,” continued he, "that Europe, and
even France, has never had a just idea of Ferdinand’s
situation at Valencey. There is a strange misunderstanding
in the world with respect to the treatment he
experienced, and still more so, with respect to his wishes
and personal opinions as to that situation. The fact is,
that he was scarcely guarded at Valencey, and that he
did not wish to escape. If any plots were contrived to
favour his evasion, he was the first to make them known.
An Irishman (Baron de Colli) gained access to his
person, and offered, in the name of George the Third, to
carry him off; but Ferdinand, so far from embracing the
offer, instantly communicated it to the proper authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His applications to me for a wife at my hands were
incessant. He spontaneously wrote to me letters of
congratulation upon every event that occurred in my
favour. He had addressed proclamations to the Spaniards
recommending their submission; he had recognized
Joseph. All these were circumstances which might, indeed,
have been considered as forced upon him; but he
requested from him the insignia of his grand order; he
tendered to me the services of his brother, Don Carlos,
to take the command of the Spanish regiments, which
were marching to Russia,—proceedings to which he was,
in no respect, obliged. To sum up all, he earnestly
solicited my permission to visit my court at Paris, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>I did not lend myself to a spectacle, which would have
astonished Europe, by displaying the full consolidation
of my power, it was because the important circumstances
which called me abroad, and my frequent absence
from the capital, deprived me of the proper opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>About the beginning of a year, at one of the Emperor’s
levees, I happened to be next to the Chamberlain,
Count d’Arberg, who had been doing duty at Valencey,
near the persons of the princes of Spain. When the
Emperor approached, he enquired if these princes conducted
themselves with propriety, and added; “You
have brought me a very pretty letter; but between
ourselves, it was you who wrote it for them.” D’Arberg
assured him, that he was altogether unacquainted even
with the nature of its contents. “Well,” said the Emperor,
“a son could not write more cordially to his
father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When our situation in Spain,” observed the Emperor,
“proved dangerous, I more than once proposed to
Ferdinand to return and reign over his people; that we
should openly carry on war against each other: and that
the contest should be decided by the fate of arms.”
“No,” answered the prince, who seems to have been
well advised, and never deviated from that way of thinking.
“My country is agitated by political disturbances;
I should but multiply its embarrassments: I might
become their victim, and lose my head upon the scaffold.
I remain; but, if you will choose a wife for me, if you
will grant me your protection and the support of your
arms, I shall set out and prove a faithful ally.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"At a later period, during our disasters, and towards
the end of 1813, I yielded to that proposal, and Ferdinand’s
marriage with Joseph’s eldest daughter was
decided; but circumstances were then no longer the
same, and Ferdinand was desirous that the marriage
should be deferred. “You can no longer,” he observed,
support me with your arms, and I ought not to make my
wife a title of exclusion in the eyes of my people." “He
left me,” continued the Emperor, “as it seemed, with
every intention of good faith, for he adhered to the principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>which he avowed on his departure, until the events
of Fontainebleau.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor declared that, had the affairs of 1814
turned out differently, he would unquestionably have
accomplished his marriage with Joseph’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, in reverting to these affairs, said, that
the impolicy of his own conduct was irrevocably decided
by the results; but that independently of this kind of
proof, depending upon consequences, he had to reproach
himself with serious faults in the execution of his plans.
One of the greatest was that of considering the dethronement
of the dynasty of the Bourbons as a matter of importance,
and of maintaining as the basis of this system,
for its successor, precisely that man, who from his qualities
and character, was certain to cause its failure.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the meeting at Bayonne, Ferdinand’s former
preceptor and his principal counsellor (Escoiquiz) at
once perceiving the vast projects entertained by the Emperor,
and pleading the cause of his master, said to him:
"You wish to create for yourself a kind of Herculean
labour, when you have but child’s play in hand. You
wish to rid yourselves of the Bourbons of Spain; why
should you be apprehensive of them? They have ceased
to exist; they are no longer French. You have nothing
to fear from them; they are altogether aliens with respect
to your nation and your manners. You have here
Madame de Montmorency, and some new ladies of your
Court; they are not more acquainted with the one than
with the other, and view them all with equal indifference."
The Emperor unfortunately formed a different
resolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>I took the liberty of telling him, I had been assured
by some Spaniards, that, if the national pride had been
respected, and the Spanish junta held at Madrid instead
of Bayonne, or even, if Charles IV. had been sent off
and Ferdinand retained, the revolution would have been
popular, and affairs would have taken another turn.
The Emperor entertained no doubt of it, and agreed that
the enterprize had been imprudently undertaken, and that
many circumstances might have been better conducted.
“Charles IV.,” said he, "was, however, too stale for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the Spaniards. Ferdinand should have been considered
in the same light. The plan most worthy of me, and
the best suited to my project, would have been a kind of
mediation like that of Switzerland. I ought to have
given a liberal constitution to the Spanish nation, and
charged Ferdinand with its execution. If he had acted
with good faith, Spain must have prospered and harmonized
with our new manners. The great object would
have been obtained, and France would have acquired an
intimate ally and an addition of power truly formidable.
Had Ferdinand, on the contrary, proved faithless to his
new engagements, the Spaniards themselves would not
have failed to dismiss him, and would have applied to
me for a ruler in his place.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At all events,” concluded the Emperor, "that unfortunate
war in Spain was a real affliction, and the first
cause of the calamities of France. After my conferences
at Erfurt with Alexander, England ought to have been
compelled to make peace by the force of arms or of reason.
She had lost the esteem of the continent; her attack
upon Copenhagen had disgusted the public mind,
while I distinguished myself at that moment by every
contrary advantage, when that disastrous affair of Spain
presented itself to effect a sudden change against me and
reinstate England in the public estimation. She was
enabled, from that moment, to continue the war; the
trade with South America was thrown open to her; she
formed an army for herself in the peninsula, and next
became the victorious agent, the main point, of all the
plots which were hatched on the continent. All this
effected my ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I was then assailed with imputations, for which,
however, I had given no cause. History will do me
justice. I was charged in that affair with perfidy, with
laying snares, and with bad faith, and yet I was completely
innocent. Whatever may have been said to the
contrary, never have I broken any engagement, or violated
my promise, either with regard to Spain or any
other power.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The world will one day be convinced, that in the
principal transactions relative to Spain I was completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>a stranger to all the domestic intrigues of its Court: that
I broke no promise made either to Charles IV. or to
Ferdinand VII.: that I violated no engagement with
the father or the son: that I made use of no falsehoods
to entice them both to Bayonne, but that they both
strove which should be the first there. When I saw
them at my feet and was enabled to form a correct opinion
of their total incapacity, I beheld with compassion
the fate of a great people; I eagerly seized the singular
opportunity, held out to me by fortune, for regenerating
Spain, rescuing her from the yoke of England,
and intimately uniting her with our system. It was, in
my conception, laying the fundamental basis of the tranquillity,
and security of Europe. But I was far from
employing for that purpose, as it has been reported, any
base and paltry stratagems. If I erred, it was, on the
contrary, by daring openness and extraordinary energy.
Bayonne was not the scene of premeditated ambush, but
of a vast master-stroke of state policy. I could have
preserved myself from these imputations by a little hypocrisy,
or by giving up the Prince of the Peace to the
fury of the people; but the idea appeared horrible to
me, and struck me as if I was to receive the price of
blood. Besides, it must also be acknowledged that
Murat did me a great deal of mischief in the whole
affair.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Be that as it may, I disdained having recourse to
crooked and common-place expedients—I found myself so
powerful!—I dared to strike from a situation too exalted.
I wished to act like Providence, which, of its own accord,
applies remedies to the wretchedness of mankind, by
means occasionally violent, but for which it is unaccountable
to human judgment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I candidly confess, however, that I engaged very
inconsiderately in the whole affair; its immorality must
have shewn itself too openly, its injustice too glaringly,
and the transactions taken altogether, present a disgusting
aspect, more particularly since my failure; for the
outrage is no longer seen but in its hideous nakedness,
stripped of all loftiness of idea, and of the numerous
benefits which it was my intention to confer. Posterity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>however, would have extolled it had I succeeded, and
perhaps with reason, on account of its vast and happy
results. Such is our lot, and such our judgment in this
world!... But I once more declare, that, in no
instance was there any breach of faith, any perfidy or
falsehood, and, what is more, there was no occasion for
them.” Here the Emperor resumed, in its totality and
in its origin, the history of the affair of Spain, repeating
many things which have been already noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Court and the reigning family,” said the Emperor,
"were split into two parties. The one was that
of the monarch, blindly governed by his favourite, the
Prince of the Peace, who had constituted himself the
real king; the other was that of the heir presumptive,
headed by his preceptor, Escoiquiz, who aspired to the
government. These two parties were equally desirous
of my support, and made me the most flattering promises.
I was, no doubt, determined to derive every
possible advantage from their situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The favourite, in order to continue in office, as well
as to shelter himself from the vengeance of the son, in
case of the father’s death, offered me, in the name of
Charles IV. to effect, in concert, the conquest of Portugal,
reserving as an asylum for himself, the sovereignty
of the Algarves.</p>

<p class='c001'>"On the other hand, the prince of the Asturias wrote
to me privately, without his father’s knowledge, soliciting
a wife of my choice, and imploring my protection.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I concluded an agreement with the former, and returned
no answer to the latter. My troops were already
admitted into the Peninsula, when the son took advantage
of a commotion to make his father abdicate and to
reign in his place.</p>

<p class='c001'>"It has been foolishly imputed to me, that I took
part in all these intrigues, but so far was I from having
any knowledge of them, that the last event, in particular,
disconcerted all my projects with the father, in consequence
of which my troops were already in the heart of
Spain. The two parties were aware, from that moment,
that I could and ought to be the arbiter between them.
The dethroned monarch and the son had recourse to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the one for the purpose of obtaining vengeance, and the
other, for the purpose of being recognised. They both
hastened to plead their cause before me, and they were
urged on by their respective councillors, those very persons
who absolutely governed them, and who saw no
means of preserving their own lives but by throwing
themselves into my arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Prince of the Peace, who had narrowly escaped
being murdered, easily persuaded Charles IV. and his
queen to undertake the journey, as they had themselves
been in danger of falling victims to the fury of the
multitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On his part, the preceptor Escoiquiz, the real author
of all the calamities of Spain, alarmed at seeing
Charles IV. protest against his abdication, and in dread
of the scaffold, unless his pupil triumphed, exerted every
means to influence the young King. This Canon, who
had besides a very high opinion of his own talents, did
not despair of making an impression on my decisions by
his arguments, and of inducing me to acknowledge Ferdinand,
making me a tender, on his own account, of his
services to govern, altogether under my control, as effectually
as the Prince of the Peace could, in the name of
Charles IV. And it must be owned,” said the Emperor,
"that, had I listened to several of his reasons, and
adopted some of his ideas, it had been much better
for me.</p>

<p class='c001'>"When I had them all assembled at Bayonne, I felt a
confidence in my political system, to which I never before
had the presumption to aspire. I had not made my
combinations, but I took advantage of the moment. I
here found the Gordian knot before me, and I cut it. I
proposed to Charles IV. and the Queen, to resign the
crown of Spain to me, and to live quietly in France.
They agreed, I may say, almost with joy, to the proposal,
so inveterately were they exasperated against their
son, and so earnestly did they and their favourite wish
to enjoy, for the future, tranquillity and safety. The
Prince of the Asturias made no extraordinary resistance
to the plan, but neither violence nor threats were employed
against him; and if he was influenced by fear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>which I am very willing to believe, that could only be
his concern.</p>

<p class='c001'>"There you have in very few words, the complete
historical sketch of the affair of Spain; whatever may
be said, or written on it must amount to that; and you
see that there could be no occasion for me to have recourse
to paltry tricks, to falsehoods, to breaches of
faith, or violation of engagements. In order to establish
my guilt, it would be necessary to shew my inclination
to degrade myself gratuitously; but of that propensity I
have never furnished an instance.</p>

<p class='c001'>"For the rest, the instant my decision was known,
the crowd of intriguers who swarm in every court, and
even those among them who had been the most active in
producing the misfortunes of their country, strove to
curry favour with Joseph, as they had done with Charles
IV. and Ferdinand VII. They watched, with extraordinary
diligence, the progress of events, and changed
sides at a later period, in proportion as difficulties encreased,
and our disasters approached. They pursued
the plan so successfully, that they are the persons, who,
at this moment, govern Ferdinand. And, what is truly
horrible, the better to secure their influence, they did not
hesitate to impute whatever was odious and criminal in
past calamities, to the mass of <em>simpletons</em>, whom they
proscribed and banished;—of those men naturally well-disposed,
and who, in principle, decidedly blamed
Ferdinand’s journey. Of this latter class, several who
opposed the journey afterwards took the oath of allegiance
to Joseph, who seemed then to be identified with the
happiness and tranquillity of their country, and continued
faithful to him, until the grand catastrophe that drove
him from the throne.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would be difficult to accumulate a greater mass of
impudence and baseness than that exhibited by all those
intriguers, the principal performers in that grand scene,
which, by the way, extenuates the degradation to which
similar acts of vileness have reduced <a id='corr300.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='France’'>France</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_300.38'><ins class='correction' title='France’'>France</ins></a></span> in the eyes
of Europe. It is evident, that they do not belong to
her exclusively. Intriguing, ambitious, rapacious men,
are every where to be found, and are every where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>same. Individuals alone are guilty; nations cannot
incur the responsibility. Their only disadvantage arises
from their being forced to witness these misdeeds.
Unhappy the country which becomes the scene of
them!”</p>

<p class='c001'>At present, the affair of Spain is perfectly known,
thanks to the writings of the principal actors, the canon
Escoiquiz, the minister Cevallos, and others, but above
all, to those of the worthy and respectable M. Llorente,
who, under the anagrammatic signature of Nellerto, has
published the Memoirs of that time, sanctioned by all the
official documents. The opposite contradictions of the
two first, their mutual disputes, the assertions and denials
of their contemporaries, have reduced their writings to
their real value, by stripping them of whatever was
erroneous, false, or even fabricated. The result is, that
in the opinion of every cool and impartial judge, they all
concur, even involuntarily, in confirming the justificatory
assertions advanced by Napoleon; not but that they
display that difference which must inevitably arise from
the diversity of party-interests; but solely because
neither of them actually establishes the grounds of
positive crimination, nor furnishes any official document
by which it can be proved, while all those which exist
attest and establish the contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may also be remarked in the history of those transactions,
which must now be considered as genuine, that
England herself was altogether a stranger to them, at
least with respect to their origin, a fact which was far
from Napoleon’s way of thinking, who charged the
English at the time with being the first cause of all the
intrigues, and who still persevered in the accusation at
St. Helena: so accustomed was he to discover them at
the bottom of every plot formed against him.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to this affair of Spain, I have further to
notice a letter from the Emperor, which throws more
light upon the subject than volumes. It is admirable,
and the events which followed stamp it as a masterpiece.
It exhibits the rapidity, the eagle-eyed view, with which
Napoleon formed his opinion of men and things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, it also shews how much the execution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of the inferiors, employed during the greater part of the
time, destroyed the finest and most exalted conceptions;
and in that point of view this letter remains a very
precious document for history. Its date renders it
prophetic.</p>

<div class='c011'>“29th March, 1808.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Monsieur le Grand Duc de Berg—I am afraid lest
you should deceive me with respect to the situation of
Spain, and lest you should also deceive yourself. Events
have been singularly complicated by the transaction
of the 20th of March. I find myself very much perplexed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<em>Do not believe that you are about to attack a disarmed
nation, and that you can, by a mere parade of
your troops, effect the subjugation of Spain.</em> The
revolution of the 20th of March proves, that the
Spaniards possess energy. You have to contend with a
new people; it has all the courage, and will display all
the enthusiasm shewn by men, who are not worn out by
political passions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The aristocracy and the clergy are the masters of
Spain. If their privileges and existence be threatened,
they will bring into the field against us levies en masse,
that may perpetuate the war. I am not without my
partisans; but if I shew myself as a conqueror they will
abandon me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Prince of the Peace is detested, because he is
accused of having betrayed Spain to France. This is the
grievance which has assisted Ferdinand’s usurpation.
The popular is the weakest party.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Prince of the Asturias does not possess a single
quality requisite for the head of a nation. That will not
prevent his being ranked as a hero, in order that he may
be opposed to us. I will have no violence employed
against the personages of this family. It can never
answer any purpose to excite hatred and inflame animosity.
Spain has a hundred thousand men under arms,
more than are necessary to carry on an internal war
with advantage. Scattered over several parts of the
country, they may serve as rallying points for a total
insurrection of the monarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“I lay before you all the obstacles which must
inevitably happen. There are others of which you must
be aware. England will not allow the opportunity to
escape her without multiplying our embarrassments.
She daily sends packet-boats to the forces, which she
maintains on the coasts of Portugal and in the Mediterranean;
and she enlists in her service Sicilians and
Portuguese.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Royal Family not having left Spain for the
purpose of establishing itself in its American colonies,
the state of the country can be changed only by a
revolution. It is, perhaps, of all others in Europe, that
which is the least prepared for one. Those who perceive
the monstrous defects of that government, and the
anarchy which has been substituted for the legitimate
authority, are the fewest in number. Those defects and
that anarchy are converted to their own advantage by
the greatest number.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can, consistently with the interests of my empire,
do a great deal of good to Spain. What are the best
means to be adopted?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shall I go to Madrid? Shall I take upon myself
the office of Grand Protector in deciding between the
father and the son? It seems to me a matter of difficulty
to support Charles IV. on the throne. His government
and his favourite are so very unpopular, that they could
not maintain themselves for three months.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ferdinand is the enemy of France, and to that consideration
he has been indebted for the crown. His
elevation to the throne would be favourable to the
factions, which for five-and-twenty years have longed for
the destruction of France. A family alliance would be
but a feeble tie. <em>Queen Elizabeth and other French
princesses</em> perished miserably when they could be immolated
with impunity to the atrocious spirit of vengeance.
My opinion is, that nothing should be hurried on, and
that our measures ought to be regulated by events as
they occur. It will be necessary to strengthen the <em>corps
<a id='corr303.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='’armée'>d’armée</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_303.38'><ins class='correction' title='’armée'>d’armée</ins></a></span></em> which will be stationed on the frontiers of
Portugal, and wait....</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“I do not approve of your Imperial Highness’s conduct
in so precipitately making yourself master of Madrid.
The army ought to have been kept ten leagues from the
capital. You had no assurance that the people and the
magistracy were about to recognise Ferdinand, without
a struggle. The Prince of the Peace must, of course,
have partisans among those employed in the public
service; there is also an habitual attachment to the old
King, which might lead to unpleasant consequences.
Your entrance into Madrid, by alarming the Spaniards,
has powerfully assisted Ferdinand. I have ordered
Savary to attend the new King, and observe what passes.
He will concert matters with your Imperial Highness.
I shall hereafter decide upon the measures necessary to
be pursued. In the mean time, I think it proper to
prescribe the following line of conduct to you:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will not pledge me to an interview, <em>in Spain</em>,
with Ferdinand, unless you consider the state of things
to be such that I ought to recognise him King of Spain.
You will behave with attention and respect to the King,
the Queen, and Prince Godoy. You will require for them,
and pay them, the same honours as formerly. You will
manage matters so as to prevent the Spaniards from entertaining
any suspicions of the course I shall pursue.
You will find no difficulty in this, as I know nothing
about it myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will make the nobility and clergy understand
that, if the interference of France be requisite in the affairs
of Spain, their privileges and immunities shall be respected.
You will assure them that the Emperor wishes
for the improvement of the political institutions of Spain,
in order to place her in a relative state to that of civilized
Europe, and to deliver her from the administration of
favouritism. You will tell the magistrates and the inhabitants
of the towns and the enlightened classes, that
the machine of the government needs reconstructing,
that Spain wants a system of laws calculated for
the protection of the people against the tyranny and
usurpations of feudality, and of establishments which
may revive industry, agriculture, and the arts. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>describe to them the state of tranquillity and ease enjoyed
by France, notwithstanding the wars in which she
has been constantly involved, and the splendour of religion,
which owes its establishment to the Concordat I
have signed with the Pope. You will explain to them
the advantages which they may derive from political
regeneration—order and peace at home, respect and
influence abroad. Such should be the spirit of your conversation
and your letters. Do not hazard any thing
hastily. I can wait at Bayonne, I can cross the Pyrenees,
and, strengthening myself towards Portugal, I can go and
conduct the war in that quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall take care of your particular interests, do not
think of them yourself. Portugal will be at my disposal.
Let no powerful object engage you and influence your
conduct; that would be injurious to me, and would be
still more hurtful to yourself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are too hasty in your instructions of the 14th;
the march you order General Dupont to take is too rapid,
on account of the event of the 19th of March. They
must be altered; you will make new arrangements; you
will receive instructions from my Minister for Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I enjoin the maintenance of the strictest discipline;
the slightest faults must not go unpunished. The inhabitants
must be treated with the greatest attention.
Above all, the churches and convents must be respected.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The army must avoid all misunderstanding with the
corps and detachments of the Spanish army; there must
not be a single flash in the pan on either side.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let Solano march beyond Badajos, but watch his
movements. Do you yourself trace out the marches of
my army, that it may be always kept at a distance of
several leagues from the Spanish corps. Should hostilities
take place, all would be lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fate of Spain can alone be decided by political
views and by negociation. I charge you to avoid all explanation
with Solano, as well as with the other Spanish
generals and governors. You will send me two expresses
daily. In case of events of superior interest, you will
despatch orderly officers. You will immediately send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>back the Chamberlain de T——, the bearer of this
despatch, and give him a detailed report.</p>

<p class='c001'>June 15th.—The weather was superb; we took an
airing in our calash, and observed very near the shore a
large vessel, which seemed to man&oelig;uvre in a singular
manner. We took her from her appearance to be the
Newcastle, which had been for some time expected to
relieve the Northumberland; but she was only one of
the Company’s ships.</p>

<p class='c001'>During part of the day, the Emperor, after running
over a great number of topics, came at length to mention
several persons who, were they at liberty, he said, would
join him at St. Helena, and he undertook to explain the
motives by which they might be influenced. From this
subject, he was led to touch upon the motives of those
who were about him. “Bertrand,” said he, "is henceforth
identified with my fate. It is an historical fact.
Gourgaud was my first orderly officer, he is my own work,
he is my child. Montholon is Semonville’s son, brother-in-law
to Joubert, a child of the revolution and of camps.
But you, my good friend," said he to the fourth, “you,”
and after a moment’s thought, he resumed; “you, my
good friend, let us know by what extraordinary chance
you find yourself here?” The answer was, “Sire, by the
influence of my happy stars, and for the honour of the
emigrants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>June 16th.—The weather was delightful; the Emperor
entered my apartment about ten o’clock. I was employed
in dressing myself, and also in dictating my Journal to
my son. The Emperor cast his eye over it for a few
instants, and said nothing; he left it to look at some
drawings. They were topographical sketches, executed
with the pen, of some of the battles in Italy, by my son,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and we felt pleasure in reserving them as an agreeable
surprise for the Emperor. We had, until then, been
employed upon them in secret.</p>

<p class='c001'>I followed the Emperor to the garden; he talked a
great deal on the articles that had been just sent to us
from England, and which chiefly consisted of furniture.
He exposed the ill-grace and awkwardness of those who
had been employed to deliver them to us. He observed
that, in presenting even what would have been most agreeable
to us, they found means to hurt our feelings. He
was on that account determined not to make use of
them, and he declined accepting two fowling-pieces,
which were particularly intended for him. The Emperor
breakfasted in the open air, and we were all invited to
his table.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation turning on fashions and dress, the
Emperor said that, at one period, he had resolved to
prohibit the use of cotton in France, for the more effectual
encouragement of the lawn and cambric trade of
our towns in Flanders. The Empress Josephine was
shocked at the idea, which she decidedly opposed, and it
was given up.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was in a happy humour for conversation,
and the weather was very mild and tolerably pleasant.
He began walking in the kind of alley which runs perpendicularly
in front of the house. The conversation
turned on the celebrated epoch of Tilsit, and the following
are the interesting particulars which I collected.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor remarked, that, had the Queen of Prussia
arrived at the commencement of the negociations, she
might have exercised considerable influence with respect
to the result. Happily, she arrived when they were
sufficiently advanced to enable the Emperor to decide
upon their conclusion four-and-twenty hours afterwards.
The King, it was thought, had prevented her early appearance,
in consequence of a rising jealousy against a
great personage, which was confidently stated, said the
Emperor, “not to have been destitute of some slight
ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The moment of her arrival, the Emperor paid her a
visit. “The Queen of Prussia,” said he, “had been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>beautiful, but she was beginning to lose some of the
charms of her youth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor declared, that the Queen received him
like Mademoiselle Duchesnois in the character of Chimene,
thrown back into a grand attitude, demanding, calling
aloud for, <em>justice</em>. In short, it was altogether a theatrical
scene: the representation was truly tragic. He was
unable to speak for an instant, and thought the only way
of extricating himself was that of bringing back the business
to the tone of regular comedy, which he attempted
by presenting her with a chair, and gently forcing her to
be seated. She proceeded, nevertheless, in the most
pathetic tone. “Prussia,” she exclaimed, “had been
blinded with respect to her power;—she had dared to
contend with a hero, to oppose herself to the destinies of
France, to neglect his auspicious friendship; she was
deservedly punished for it. The glory of the great Frederic,
his memory, and his inheritance had puffed up the
pride of Prussia, and had caused her ruin!” She solicited,
supplicated, implored. Magdeburg, in particular,
was the object of her efforts and wishes. The Emperor
kept his ground as well as he could. Fortunately, the
husband made his appearance. The Queen reproved,
with an expressive look, the unseasonable interruption,
and shewed some pettishness. In fact, the King attempted
to take part in the conversation, spoiled the
whole affair, “and I was,” said the Emperor, “set at
liberty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor entertained the Queen at dinner. She
played off, said he, all her wit against me; she had a
great deal; all her manners, which were very fascinating;
all her coquetry; she was not without charms.
“But I was determined not to yield. I found it necessary,
however, to keep a great command over myself,
that I might continue exempt from all kind of engagement,
and every expression, which might be taken in a
doubtful sense, and the more so, because I was carefully
watched, and particularly by Alexander.” Just before
sitting down to dinner Napoleon took from a flower-stand
a very beautiful rose, which he presented to the
Queen. She at first expressed by the motion of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>hand a kind of prepared refusal; but suddenly recollecting
herself, she said; <em>Yes, but at least with Magdeburg</em>.
The Emperor replied, “But ... I must observe
to your Majesty, that it is I who present, and you, who
are about to receive it.” The dinner and the remainder
of the time passed over in that manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Queen was seated at table between the two Emperors,
who rivalled each other in gallantry. She was
placed near Alexander’s best ear; with one he can
scarcely hear at all. The evening came, and, the Queen
having retired, the Emperor, who had shown the most
engaging attentions to his guests, but, who had at the
same time, been often driven to an extremity, resolved
to come to a point. He sent for M. de Talleyrand, and
Prince Kourakin, talked big to them, and letting fly,
continued he, some hard words, observed, that, after all,
a woman and a piece of gallantry ought not to alter a
system conceived for the destiny of a great people, and
that he insisted upon the immediate conclusion of the
negociations, and the signing of the treaty; which took
place according to his orders. “Thus,” said he, "the
Queen of Prussia’s conversation advanced the treaty by
a week or a fortnight."</p>

<p class='c001'>The Queen was preparing to renew her attacks the
next day, and was indignant when she heard that the
treaty was signed. She wept a great deal, and determined
to see the Emperor Napoleon no more. She
would not accept a second invitation to dinner. Alexander
was himself obliged to prevail upon her. She
complained most bitterly, and maintained, that Napoleon
had broken his word. But Alexander had been
always present. He had even been a dangerous witness,
ready to give evidence of the slightest action or word on
the part of Napoleon in her favour. “He has made
you no promise,” was his observation to her; “if you
can prove the contrary, I here pledge myself, as between
man and man, to make him keep his promise, and he
will do so, I am convinced.”—"But he has given me
to understand," said she, ... “No,” replied Alexander,
“and you have nothing to reproach him with.”
She came at length. Napoleon, who had no longer any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>occasion to be on his guard against her, redoubled his
attentions. She played off, for a few moments, the airs
of an offended coquette, and when the dinner was over,
and she was about to retire, Napoleon presented his
hand, and conducted her to the middle of the staircase,
where he stopped. She squeezed his hand, and said
with a kind of tenderness; “Is it possible, that after
having had the honour of being so near to the hero of
the century and of history, he will not leave me the
power and satisfaction of being enabled to assure him,
that he has attached me to him for life?”—"Madam,"
replied the Emperor in a serious tone, “I am to be
pitied; it is the result of my unhappy stars.” He then
took leave of her. When she reached her carriage, she
threw herself into it in tears; sent for Duroc, whom
she highly esteemed, renewed all her complaints to him,
and said, pointing to the palace; “There is a place in
which I have been cruelly deceived!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Queen of Prussia,” said the Emperor, “was
unquestionably gifted with many happy resources; she
possessed a great deal of information and had many excellent
capabilities. It was she who really reigned for
more than fifteen years. She also, in spite of my dexterity
and all my exertions, took the lead in conversation,
and constantly maintained the ascendancy. She
touched, perhaps, too often upon her favourite topic,
but she did so, however, with great plausibility and
without giving the slightest cause of uneasiness. It
must be confessed that she had an important object in
view, and that the time was short and precious.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One of the high contracting parties,” said the Emperor,
“had frequently assured her, that she ought to
have come in the beginning or not at all, and observed
that, for his part, he had done every thing in his power
to induce her to come at once. It was suspected,” continued
the Emperor, “that he had a personal motive to
gratify by her coming; but, on the other hand, the
husband had a motive equally personal in opposing it.”
Napoleon believed him to have been very kind and a
sincere friend in the business.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The king of Prussia,” said the Emperor, "had requested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>his audience of leave on that very day, but I
postponed it for four-and-twenty hours, at the secret
entreaty of Alexander. The king of Prussia never forgave
me for putting off that audience; so clearly did it
seem to him, that Royal Majesty was insulted by my
refusal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another heavy charge against me, and of which he
has never been able to divest his feelings, was that of
having violated, as he said, his territory of Anspach in
our campaign of Austerlitz. In all our subsequent interviews,
however important the subjects of our discussion,
he laid them all aside for the purpose of proving
that I had really violated his territory of Anspach. He
was wrong; but in short, it was his conviction, and his
resentment was that of an honest man. His wife, however,
was vexed at it, and wished him to pursue a higher
system of politics.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon reproached himself with a real fault, in
allowing the king of Prussia’s presence at Tilsit. His
first determination was to prevent his coming. He
would then have been less bound to shew any attention
to his interests. He might have kept Silesia, he might
have aggrandized Saxony with it, and have probably
reserved for himself a different kind of destiny. He further
remarked: “I learn, that the politicians of the
present day find great fault with my treaty of Tilsit;
they have discovered, that I had, by that means, placed
Europe at the mercy of the Russians; but if I had succeeded
at Moscow, and it is now known how very near
I was, they would, no doubt, have admired us for having,
on the contrary, by that treaty, placed the Russians at
the mercy of Europe. I entertained great designs with
respect to the Germans.... But I failed, and
therefore I was wrong. This is according to every rule
of justice....”</p>

<p class='c001'>Almost every day, at Tilsit, the two Emperors and
the King rode out on horseback together, but, said Napoleon,
“the latter was always awkward and unlucky.”
The Prussians were visibly mortified by it. Napoleon
was constantly between the two sovereigns; but either
the King fell behind, or jostled and incommoded Napoleon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>He shewed the same awkwardness on their return:
the two Emperors dismounted in an instant, and took
each other by the hand to go up stairs together. But,
as the honours were done by Napoleon, he could not
enter without first seeing the King pass. It was sometimes
necessary to wait for him a long time, and, as the
weather was often rainy, it happened that the two Emperors
got wet on the king’s account, to the great
dissatisfaction of all the spectators.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This awkwardness,” said the Emperor, “was the
more glaring, as Alexander possesses all the graces, and
is equal, in elegance of manners, to the most polished
and amiable ornaments of our Parisian drawing-rooms.
The latter was at times so tired of his companion,
who seemed lost in his own vexations, or in something
else, that we mutually agreed on breaking up our
common meeting to get rid of him. We separated immediately
after dinner, under the pretence of some
particular business; but Alexander and I met shortly
afterwards, to take tea with one another, and we then
continued in conversation until midnight, and even
beyond it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alexander and Napoleon met again some time after at
Erfurt, and exchanged the most striking testimonies of
affection. Alexander expressed with earnestness the
sentiments of tender friendship and real admiration which
he entertained for Napoleon. They passed some days
together in the enjoyment of the charms of perfect intimacy
and of the most familiar communications of private
life. “We were,” said the Emperor, “two young men
of quality, who, in their common pleasures, had no
secret from each other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon had sent for the most distinguished performers
of the French Theatre. A celebrated actress,
Mademoiselle B——, attracted the attention of his guest,
who had a momentary fancy to get acquainted with her.
He asked his companion whether any inconvenience
was likely to be the result. “None,” answered the
latter; “only,” added he, intentionally, “it is a certain
and rapid mode of making yourself known to all Paris.
After to-morrow, post-day, the most minute details
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>will be dispatched, and in a short time, not a statuary
at Paris but will be qualified to give a model of your
person from head to foot.” The danger of such a kind
of publicity appeased the monarch’s rising passion;
“for,” observed Napoleon, “he was very circumspect
with regard to that point, and he recollected no
doubt the old adage, When the mask falls, the hero
disappears.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor assured us that, had it been his wish,
Alexander would certainly have given him his sister in
marriage; his politics would have dictated the match,
even had his inclination been against it. He was petrified
when he heard of the marriage with Austria, and
exclaimed—"This consigns me to my native forests."
If he seemed to shuffle at first, it was because some time
was necessary to enable him to come to a decision. His
sister was very young, and the consent of his mother
was requisite. This was settled by Paul’s will, and the
Empress-mother was one of Napoleon’s bitterest enemies.
She believed all the absurdities, all the ridiculous stories,
which had been circulated concerning him. “How,”
she exclaimed, "can I give my daughter to a man who
is unfit to be any woman’s husband? Shall another man
take possession of my daughter’s bed, if it be necessary,
that she should have children? She is not formed for
such a fate."—"Mother," said Alexander, “can you be
so credulous as to believe the calumnies of London and
the insinuations of the saloons of Paris? If that be the
only difficulty, if it be that alone which gives you pain, I
answer for him, and many others have it in their power
to answer for him with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"If Alexander’s affection for me was sincere," said
the Emperor, “it was alienated from me by the force of
intrigue. Certain persons, M——, or others, at the
instigation of T——, lost no seasonable opportunity of
mentioning instances of my turning him into ridicule,
and they assured him, that at Tilsit and Erfurt, he no
sooner turned his back than I took the opportunity of
laughing at his expense. Alexander is very susceptible,
and they must have easily soured his mind. It is certain,
that he made bitter complaints of it at Vienna during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>congress, and yet nothing was more false; he pleased
me, and I loved him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>S——, one of Napoleon’s aides-de-camp, was
sent immediately after the treaty of Tilsit to Alexander
at Petersburg, and was loaded with favours. The efforts
and liberality of Alexander were inexhaustible to render
himself agreeable to his new ally.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same aide-de-camp became afterwards minister
of the police, and in 1814, soon after the restoration, he
is said to have made a striking allusion to his mission in
Russia. A person deeply in the confidence of the King,
addressing him at the Tuileries, in a manner altogether
careless and unreserved, said, “Now that all is over, you
may speak out; pray, who was your agent at Hartwell?”
(This was, as every one knows, the residence of
Louis XVIII. in England.) S——, astonished at the
want of delicacy evinced by M. de B——, answered
with dignity:—"M. le Comte, the Emperor considered
the asylum of kings as an inviolable sanctuary. It was
a principle which he impressed upon his police and we
adhered to it. We have since learnt, that the same
conduct was not observed with respect to him. But
you, Sir, should entertain less doubt upon the subject
than any other person. When I arrived at Petersburg,
you were there on the part of the king. The Emperor
Alexander, in the first warmth of his reconciliation,
acquainted me with every thing that concerned you, and
asked me whether it was the wish of my government
that you should be ordered to leave his dominions. I
had received no instructions upon that head. I wrote
for them to the Emperor. His answer was, by return
of courier, that he was satisfied with the sincere friendship
of Alexander; that he would never interfere in
his private arrangements; that he entertained no
personal hatred against the Bourbons; and that, if
he believed it were possible for them to accept it,
he would offer them an asylum in France, and any royal
residence, which might be agreeable to them. If you
were then ignorant of these instructions, you will, no
doubt, find them among the papers of the foreign
office."</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>17th of June.—The Emperor went out early in the
morning. He ordered his calash for the purpose of
taking a ride before breakfast. When he was stepping
into it, we were informed, that the Newcastle man of
war and the Orontes frigate were tacking to enter the
port. These two vessels had overshot the island in the
night, and were obliged to work to windward. They
sailed from England on the 23rd of April and brought
the bill respecting the Emperor’s detention. The English
legislature had sanctioned by law the determination
of ministers on that subject. The Commissioners
of Austria, France and Russia were on board these
vessels.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of the day, the Emperor, speaking of
the forms and costumes which he had established, and
of the etiquette which he had introduced, <a id='corr315.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='said'>said,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_315.22'><ins class='correction' title='said'>said,</ins></a></span> “I found
it a very difficult thing to give myself up to my own inclinations.
I started into public notice from the multitude.
Necessity compelled me to observe a degree of
state; to adopt a certain system of solemnity; in a
word, to establish an etiquette. I should otherwise
have been every day liable to be slapped upon the shoulder.
In France, we are naturally inclined to a misplaced
familiarity, and I had to guard myself particularly against
those who had at once, without any preparatory study,
become men of education. We become courtiers very
easily; we are very obsequious in the outset, and addicted
to flattery and adulation: but unless it be repressed, a
certain familiarity soon takes place, which might with
great facility be carried as far as influence. It is well
known that our kings were not exempt from this inconvenience.”
Here the Emperor alluded to a very characteristic
anecdote of the time of Louis XIV.—that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>courtier, of the number of whose children that prince
enquired at his levee. “Four, Sire,” was the reply.
The king, having occasion to speak to him two or three
times in public during the day, put precisely the same
question to him, “Pray, Sir, how many children have
you?” The answer was uniformly the same; “Four,
Sire.” At length, as the King was at play in the evening,
he repeated the usual question. “How many children
have you?”—“Six, Sire.” <a id='corr316.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='How'>“How</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_316.8'><ins class='correction' title='How'>“How</ins></a></span> the plague can
that be?” said the king, “for if I recollect right, you
told me you had but four.”—“Really, Sire, I was afraid
of fatiguing you with the constant repetition of the same
thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"“Sire,” observed one of the company to the Emperor,
"I can mention an anecdote of a neighbouring
country, worthy of that which we have just heard, and
which may enable us to compare the gratuitous insolence
of an absolute monarch’s courtier with the open resentment
of a man, who has nothing to fear from his constitutional
sovereign.</p>

<p class='c001'>"A person moving in the circles of high life in London,
had to complain of a great personage, by whom he
had been very ill-used, and pledged himself to his friends
to have ostensible satisfaction. Having learnt that the
great personage was to honour a very brilliant party
with his presence, he attended himself at an early hour
and placed himself near the lady of the house. The
great personage had paid his respects to the lady, and,
after the customary compliments, being about to join the
rest of the company, he had scarcely turned round, before
the offended person, leaning carelessly towards her,
said, with a loud voice, “Who is your fat friend?” The
lady reddened, touched him with her elbow, and whispered;
"Hold your tongue, I beg, don’t you see it is
the Prince?" The gentleman replied, in a higher tone
than before;—"How, the Prince!—Well, upon my
honour, he is grown as fat as a pig."</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one is at liberty to decide upon the relative demerits
of these two insolent characters. Both are, no
doubt, very blameable, and if there be less coarseness in
the conduct of our countryman, it must also be allowed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>that his impertinence is altogether without an object and
purely gratuitous.</p>

<p class='c001'>During another part of the day, the Emperor conversed
at great length on the sittings of the Council of
State. I had pointed out some, and of others we had
but a doubtful recollection; or they had altogether slipped
our memory. <a id='corr317.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“Well,'>“Well,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_317.7'><ins class='correction' title='“Well,'>“Well,”</ins></a></span> said he, “in a short time,
scarcely a trace of them will be left behind.” Being unable
to sleep that night, I thought of these words, and
endeavoured to recollect, as minutely as I could, every
thing I was acquainted with respecting the Council of
State;—the seat of its meetings, its usages, forms, &amp;c.;
and I do not think I can <a id='corr317.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beter'>better</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_317.13'><ins class='correction' title='beter'>better</ins></a></span> employ the leisure of our
solitude at St. Helena, than by giving an account of them
here. I shall occasionally add what I may recollect of
the sittings at which I was present. There are persons
to whom these details will not be destitute of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hall of the Council of State, in the Tuileries, the
place where the sittings were usually held, was on the
same side with, and of the entire length of, the chapel.
In the partition wall were several large doors, which
being thrown open on Sundays, formed passages to the
chapel. It was a fine oblong apartment. At one of its
extremities, towards the interior of the palace, was a
large and beautiful door, by which the Emperor entered,
when, attended by his Court, he proceeded on Sunday
to hear mass. It was only opened the rest of the
week for the Emperor, when he went to his Council of
State. The members of the Council entered only by two
small doors, contrived for that purpose in the opposite
extremity.</p>

<p class='c001'>A row of tables, which occupied the whole length of
the hall, on the right and left, was arranged there only
when the council assembled, and the space left was sufficient
to admit of seats within near the wall, and of a
free passage without. There sat the Councillors of
State, in their respective order of precedence; their
places were, besides, designated by portfolios, bearing
their names, and containing their papers. At the extremity
of the hall, towards the grand entrance, and
across the two rows, were placed similar tables for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Masters of Requests. The Auditors were seated on
stools or chairs, behind the Councillors of State.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the upper extremity of the hall, opposite to the
grand entrance, was the Emperor’s place on an <a id='corr318.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='elevavation'>elevation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.4'><ins class='correction' title='elevavation'>elevation</ins></a></span>
of one or two steps. There was his arm chair,
and a small table covered with a piece of rich tapestry,
and furnished with all the necessary articles, with paper,
pens, ink, penknives, and which were also laid before the
Members of the Council.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the right of the Emperor, but below, and on a level
with us, was the Prince Arch-chancellor, with a separate
small table; on his left, the Prince Arch-treasurer, who
attended very seldom; and finally, at the left of the
latter, M. Locre, who drew up the official account of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class='c001'>When any princes of the family happened to be present,
a similar table was placed for them on the same
line, and according to their respective rank. If any of
the ministers were present, and they were all at liberty
to attend whenever they pleased, they took their places at
the side tables, at the head of the councillors of state.
The enclosed space was vacant, and none ever passed
through it, but the Emperor, or the Members of the
Council, when proceeding to take the oath of allegiance
to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ushers moved silently about the hall, for the service
of the members, even during the deliberations of
the Council. The members left their places whenever
they pleased, to obtain from their colleagues any particular
documents of which they might be in want, or for
any other purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The upper compartments of the hall displayed allegorical
paintings, relative to the functions of the Council
of State, such as Justice, Commerce, Industry, &amp;c.
and the ceiling was decorated with the beautiful picture
of the battle of Austerlitz, by Gros. Thus, under one of
the most glorious laurels with which he ennobled France,
did Napoleon preside over its internal administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in that place that for nearly eighteen months I
enjoyed the inestimable advantage, the unparalleled
satisfaction, of attending twice a week sittings so interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>by their special objects, and rendered still more
so by the constant presence of the Emperor, who seemed
to be the soul and life of the deliberations. It was there
that I have seen him protract the discussions from eleven
in the morning until nine at night, and display at the
conclusion as much activity, copiousness, and freshness
of mind and understanding as he did in the beginning,
while we were ready to sink with weariness and
fatigue.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the court was at St. Cloud the council was
held there, but when the sitting was to take place at too
early an hour, or it was likely to last long, the Emperor
adjourned the proceedings until the members could take
some refreshment, which was served up in the adjacent
apartment, on small tables most magnificently supplied,
as if by enchantment. I may truly say, that it would
be impossible to give a just idea of the fascinations we
witnessed in every thing belonging to the Imperial
palaces.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hour of the Council’s sitting was regularly noticed
in our letters of convocation, but the hour was generally
eleven.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a sufficient number of members was present,
the Arch-Chancellor[note previously in text Arch-chancellor p2], who was always there the first,
and who presided in the Emperor’s absence, opened the
sitting, and called the attention of the Council to what
was then called the <em>little order of the day</em>, and which
solely embraced simple matters of a local nature and of
mere form.</p>

<p class='c001'>About an hour later, in general, the beating of the
drum in the interior of the Palace announced the Emperor’s
arrival. The grand entrance was thrown open;
his Majesty was announced; all the Council rose, and
the Emperor appeared, preceded by his Chamberlain and
his Aide-de-Camp on duty, who presented his chair,
received his hat, and continued behind him during the
sitting, ready to receive and execute his orders.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Arch-Chancellor then presented to the Emperor
the <em>great order of the day</em>, which contained the series of
objects under deliberation. The Emperor read them
over, and pointed out in a distinct tone that which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>wished to have discussed. The Councillor of State,
nominated for the purpose, read his report, and the
deliberations commenced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every member was at liberty to speak; if several rose
at the same time, the order of precedence was regulated
by the Emperor. The members spoke from their places
sitting. No written speeches were allowed to be read;
it was requisite that they should be made extemporaneously.
When the Emperor thought the question, in
which he usually took no inconsiderable share himself,
sufficiently discussed, he made a summary of the arguments,
which was always luminous, and frequently
marked with novelty and point, came to a conclusion,
and put it to the vote.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already noticed the freedom enjoyed in these
debates. The animation of the speakers, increasing by
degrees, became sometimes excessive, and the discussion
was often protracted beyond measure, particularly when
the Emperor, occupied probably with some other subject,
seemed, either from distraction or something else, to be
altogether ignorant of what was going on. He then
commonly cast a vacant look over the hall, cut pencils with
his penknife, pricked the cover of his table or the arm of
his chair with the point of it, or employed his pencil or
pen in scrawling whimsical marks or sketches, which,
after he was gone, excited the covetous attention of
the young members, who made a kind of scramble for
them; and it was curious to observe, when he happened
to have traced the name of some country or capital, the
hyperbolical inferences that were sought to be extracted
from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes too, when the Emperor entered the
Council, as soon as his dinner was ended, and after
having undergone great fatigue during the morning, he
would fold his arms upon the table, lay down his head
and fall asleep. The Arch-Chancellor proceeded with
the deliberations, which were continued without interruption,
and the Emperor, on awaking, immediately
caught up the thread of the discussion, though the
previous subject might have been ended and another
introduced. The Emperor often asked for a glass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>water and sugar; and a table in the adjoining room was
always laid out with refreshments for his use, without
any precautions being adopted as to the individuals who
were permitted to approach it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, it is well known, was in the habit of
taking snuff almost every minute: this was a sort of
mania which seized him chiefly during intervals of
abstraction. His snuff-box was speedily emptied; but
he still continued to thrust his fingers into it, or to raise
it to his nose, particularly when he was himself speaking.
Those Chamberlains, who proved themselves most expert
and assiduous in the discharge of their duties, would
frequently endeavour, unobserved by the Emperor, to
take away the empty box and substitute a full one in its
stead; for there existed a great competition of attention
and courtesy among the Chamberlains who were habitually
employed in services about the Emperor’s person;
an honour which was very much envied. These persons
were, however, seldom changed, either because they
intrigued to retain their places, or because it was
naturally most agreeable to the Emperor to continue
them in posts, with the duties of which they were
acquainted. It was the business of the Grand Marshal
(Duroc) to make all these arrangements. The following
is an instance of the attentions paid by the Emperor’s
Chamberlains. One of them, having observed that the
Emperor on going to the theatre frequently forgot his
opera-glass, of which he made constant use, got one
made exactly like it, so that the first time he saw the
Emperor without his glass, he presented his own to him,
and the difference was not observed. On his return
from the theatre, the Emperor was not a little surprised
to find that he had two glasses exactly alike. Next day,
he inquired how the new opera-glass had made its
appearance, and the Chamberlain replied that it was
one which he kept in reserve in case it might be
wanted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor always shewed himself very sensible of
these attentions, which were innocent in themselves, and
which were calculated to make an impression on the
feelings, when dictated only by love and respect; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>then the individual was not acting the part of a slavish
courtier, but that of an affectionate and devoted servant.
Napoleon, on his part, whatever may have been reported
to the contrary in the saloons of Paris, shewed sincere
regard for the persons of his household. When he
quitted Paris for St. Cloud, Malmaison, or any other of
his country residences, he usually invited the individuals
of his household to his private evening parties; and thus
was formed a pleasant family circle, admittance to which
was held to be a very high honour. When in the country,
he also admitted his Chamberlains to dine at his table.
One day, while at dinner at Trianon, being troubled
with a severe cold in his head, a complaint to which he
was very subject, he found himself in want of a handkerchief;
the servants immediately ran to fetch one, but
meanwhile the Chamberlain on duty, who was a relation
of Maria Louisa’s, drew a clean one unfolded from his
pocket, and wished to take the other from the Emperor.
“I thank you,” said Napoleon; “but I will never have
it said that I allowed M—— to touch a handkerchief
which I had used;” and he threw it on the ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the man who in certain circles was described
as being coarse and brutal, ill treating all his household,
and even behaving rudely to the ladies of the palace! The
Emperor, on the contrary, was a scrupulous observer of
decorum. He was very sensible to all the little attentions
he received; and though it was a sort of system with
him to suffer no manifestation of gratitude to escape him,
yet the expression of his eye or the tone of his voice
sufficiently denoted what he really felt. Unlike those
whose lips overflow with the expression of sentiments
which their hearts never feel, Napoleon seemed to make
it a rule to repress or disguise the kind emotions by
which he was frequently inspired. I believe I have
already mentioned this fact; but the following are some
fresh proofs of it, which recur to me at this moment.
These circumstances are the more characteristic, since
they occurred at Longwood, where Napoleon might have
been expected to indulge his natural feelings with less
restraint than during the possession of his power.</p>

<p class='c001'>I usually sat beside my son, while he wrote from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Emperor’s dictation. The Emperor always walked about
the room when dictating, and he frequently stood for a
moment behind my chair, to look over the writing, so
that he might know where to take up the thread of his
dictation. When in this situation, how many times has
my head been enclosed between his arms, and even
slightly pressed to his bosom! Then, immediately checking
himself, he seemed to have been merely leaning
with his elbows upon my shoulders, or playfully bearing
all his weight upon me, as if to try my strength.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was very fond of my son, and I have
often seen him bestow a sort of manual caress on him;
and then, as it were, to do away with the effect of this
motion, he would immediately accompany it by some
words uttered in a loud and somewhat sharp tone of
voice. One day, as he was entering the drawing-room,
in a moment of good-humour and forgetfulness, I saw
him take Madame Bertrand’s hand and affectionately
raise it to his lips; but, suddenly recollecting himself,
he turned away, in a manner that would have had a very
awkward effect, had not Madame Bertrand, with that exquisite
grace for which she is so peculiarly distinguished,
removed all embarrassment, by impressing a kiss on the
hand that had been extended to her. But these stories
have carried me very far from my subject. I must return
to the Council of State.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the reports, plans of resolutions, and decrees,
which we had to discuss, were printed and distributed to
us at our own houses. There was one subject, for example,
relating to the University, which was perhaps
twenty times drawn up. Others lingered for a length of
time in the portfolios, or were at length totally dropped,
without any cause being assigned.</p>

<p class='c001'>On my return from my mission to Holland, just after
I had been created a member of the Council of State, I
rose to speak on the subject of the Conscription. I was
naturally interested in all that related to naval affairs;
my mind was full of enthusiasm, and was stored with
the observations which I had just collected in Holland.
I proposed that all the Dutch conscripts, in consideration
of their natural predilections, should be permitted, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>they chose, to enter the naval service; and moreover,
that the privilege of this choice should be extended to
all the French conscripts. I pointed out the inconveniences
which such an arrangement was calculated to obviate,
and developed the advantages which it was likely
to ensure. I observed that it was impossible to render
our seamen too numerous. Our ships’ crews, I said,
would thus become regiments: the same men would at
once be sailors and soldiers, gunners and pontooners;
we should obtain double service at the same rate of pay.
My speech had, up to this point, been as favourably received
as I could wish: and in my own mind I congratulated
myself on my success; when on a sudden I
lost all power of utterance. The train of my ideas immediately
became disconnected, and I stood mute and
confounded, without knowing where I was or what I
was doing. This was the first time I had ventured to
speak; and I had made an extraordinary effort to surmount
my natural diffidence. Profound silence reigned
in the assembly, a hundred eyes were fixed upon me,
and I was ready to sink under the weight of my embarrassment.
I had no alternative but to confess my
painful situation, to tell the Emperor, frankly, that I
would rather be in a battle; and finally to ask permission
to conclude my address by reading a few lines from a
written paper which I had brought with me. From
that moment, however, I never felt any wish to speak in
the Council of State; I was completely cured of all desire
to exert my eloquence in future. But, in spite of
this unfortunate circumstance, my brief address had attracted
the notice of the Emperor; for, a few days afterwards,
the Aid-de-Camp on duty (Count Bertrand),
informed me that the Emperor, while playing at billiards,
seeing the Minister of the Marine enter, said to him:—"Well,
Sir, Las Cases read to us, at the Council, a very
good memorial on the composition of the navy; he was
not at all of your opinion respecting the age at which
seamen should be allowed to enter the service."</p>

<p class='c001'>Every sitting of the Council, at which the Emperor
presided, presented the highest degree of interest, for he
never failed to deliver a speech himself, and all the observations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>that fell from him were important. I was
always delighted with his speeches: but a circumstance
that both surprised and vexed me was to hear some of
the remarks which had fallen from the Emperor in the
course of the day at the Council of State, repeated and
often ill-naturedly perverted in the saloons of Paris in
the evening. How could this happen? Was it owing to
the inaccuracy of the individual who had reported what
he heard, or to the malignity of him to whom it had
been reported? Be this as it may, the fact was as I have
stated.</p>

<p class='c001'>I often entertained the idea of writing out the speeches
which I had heard the Emperor deliver, and I now very
deeply regret having neglected to do so. The following
are a few reminiscences which occur to me at this
moment:</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, the Emperor, speaking on the political
rights which it was proper to concede to persons of
French origin born in foreign countries, said, “The
noblest title in the world is that of being born a Frenchman;
it is a title conferred by Heaven, and which no
individual on earth should have the power to withdraw.
For my part, I wish that every man of French origin,
though he were a foreigner in the tenth generation,
should still be a Frenchman, if he wishes to claim the
title. Were he to present himself on the other bank of
the Rhine, saying, I wish to be a Frenchman, I would
have his voice to be more powerful than the law; the
barriers should fall before him, and he should return
triumphant to the bosom of our common mother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion, he said, though I do not now
recollect on what subject he was speaking: “The Constituent
Assembly acted very unwisely in abolishing
purely titular nobility; a measure which was calculated
to humble so many individuals. I do better. I confer
on all Frenchmen titles, of which every one has reason
to be proud.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At another time, he used the following words, which
perhaps, I have already quoted:—"I wish to raise the
glory of the French name to such a pitch as to make it
the envy of all nations. I will, with God’s help, bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>it to pass, that in whatever part of Europe a Frenchman
may travel, he shall always find himself at home."</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Council of State a discussion once arose <a id='corr326.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='respecing'>respecting</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_326.3'><ins class='correction' title='respecing'>respecting</ins></a></span>
the plan of a decree. The result of this discussion
has now escaped my recollection, but I know the subject
was to determine that the kings of the Imperial Families,
occupying foreign thrones, should leave their titles and
all the etiquette of royalty on the frontier, and only resume
them on quitting France. The Emperor replying
to some one who had started objections to this, and at
the same time explaining the motives for the measure,
said: “But for these monarchs I reserve in France a
still higher title; they shall be more than kings: they
shall be French Princes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I might multiply quotations of this kind to an endless
length: they must be engraven in the recollection of all
the members of the Council, as well as in mine. It will
perhaps be a matter of surprise that, having seen the
Emperor so frequently, and having heard him deliver
sentiments such as these, I should have said, I did not
know him at the period when I followed him to St. Helena.
My answer is that at that time I felt, with regard
to the Emperor, more of admiration and enthusiasm than
of real love, arising from an intimate knowledge of his
character. Even in the palace, we were assailed by so
many absurd reports respecting the private character and
conduct of Napoleon, and we had so little direct communication
with him, that, by dint of hearing the same
stories repeated over and over, I imbibed, in spite of
myself, a certain degree of doubt and distrust. He was
described to be of a dissembling and cunning disposition,
and it was affirmed that he could, when in public, make
a parade of fine sentiment, which he was totally incapable
of feeling; in short, that he possessed an eloquent
tongue and an insensible heart. Thus it was not until I
became thoroughly acquainted with his character that I
was convinced how really and truly he was what he appeared
to be. Never perhaps was any man in the world so
devotedly attached to France, and there was no sacrifice
which he would not readily have made to preserve her
glory. This is sufficiently evident from his conduct at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Chatillon, and after his return from Waterloo. He expressed
himself truly and energetically on his rock, when
he used these remarkable words, which I have before
quoted: “No, my real sufferings are not here!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following anecdotes have reference to other subjects,
partly grave and partly humourous. One day the
Councillor of State, General Gassendi, taking part in the
discussion of the moment, dwelt much upon the doctrines
of economists. The Emperor, who was much attached
to his old artillery comrade, stopped him, saying: “My
dear General, where did you gain all this knowledge?
Where did you imbibe these principles?” Gassendi, who
very seldom spoke in the Council, after defending himself
in the best way he could, finding himself driven into
his last entrenchments, replied that he had, after all,
borrowed his opinions from Napoleon himself. “How?”
exclaimed the Emperor, with warmth, “What do you
say? Is it possible? From me, who have always thought
that if there existed a monarchy of granite, the chimeras
of political economists would reduce it to powder!” And
after some other remarks, partly ironical and partly serious,
he concluded;—"Go, General! you must have
fallen asleep in your office, and have dreamed all this."
Gassendi, who was rather irascible, replied, “Oh! as
for falling asleep in our offices, Sire, I defy any one to
do that with you, you plague us too much for that.”
All the Council burst into a fit of laughter, and the
Emperor laughed louder than any one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another time a question arose respecting the organization
of the Illyrian provinces, just after they had fallen
into the power of France. Those provinces, bordering
on Turkey, were occupied by regiments of Croatian
troops, organized on a peculiar plan. They were, in
short, military colonies, the idea of which was conceived
upwards of a century ago by the great Prince Eugene,
for the purpose of establishing a barrier against the incursions
and ravages of the Turks, and had well fulfilled
the purpose for which they were destined. The committee
appointed to draw up a plan for the organization
of the Provinces, proposed that the Croatian regiments
should be disbanded, and replaced by a national guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>similar to ours. “Are you mad?” exclaimed the Emperor,
on hearing the report read; “are the Croatians
Frenchmen? or have you understood the excellence,
utility, and importance of the institution?”—"Sire,"
replied the person, who conceived himself bound to defend
the report, “the Turks will not now venture to
resume their transgressions.”—"And why not?"—"Sire,
because your majesty is become their neighbour."—"Well,
and what of that?"—"Sire, they will be too
much awed by your power."—"Oh yes, Sire, Sire," replied
the Emperor sharply, “a truce to compliments at
present, or, if you like, go and present them to the Turks,
who will answer you by a discharge of musquetry, and
you can return and give me an account of the affair.”
The Emperor immediately decided that the Croatian
regiments should be preserved.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, the plan of a decree respecting ambassadors
was submitted to the consideration of the Council of
State. This plan, though very remarkable, was, I believe,
never published to the world. The coolness which
the Council evinced on this subject caused the matter to
be dropped; many other plans also experienced the
same fate; which, it may be observed, affords an additional
proof of the independence of the Council, and
shews that Napoleon possessed more moderation than is
generally believed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, who appeared to be the only individual
to support the decree, and who adhered to it very firmly,
made some very curious remarks in its defence. He
wished that ambassadors should enjoy no prerogatives or
privileges which might place them above the laws of the
country. At most, he was only willing to grant that
they should be subject to a higher kind of jurisdiction.
“For example,” said he, "I have no objection that they
should be brought to trial only after a preliminary decision
of an assemblage of the ministers and high dignitaries
of the empire; that they should be tried only by a
special tribunal, composed of the first magistrates and
functionaries of the state. It will perhaps be said that
sovereigns, finding their own dignity compromised in
the persons of their representatives, will not send ambassadors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>to my Court. Well, where will be the harm of
that? I can withdraw mine from foreign Courts, and thus
the country will be relieved from the burden of enormous
and very frequently useless salaries. Why should ambassadors
be exempt from the law? They are sent with
the view of being agreeable, and for the purpose of
maintaining an interchange of friendship and favour
between their respective sovereigns. If they overstep
the limits of their duty they should be reduced to the
class of common offenders, and placed within the pale of
the general law. I cannot tacitly permit ambassadors
at my Court to act the part of hired spies: if I do, I must
be content to be regarded as a fool, and to submit to all
the mischief to which I may be exposed. It is only necessary
to have the matter well understood before-hand,
so as to obviate the impropriety of violating received
customs, and what has hitherto been regarded as the law
of nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>“During the height of a celebrated crisis,” continued
the Emperor, “I received information that a great personage
had taken refuge in the house of M. de Cobentzel,
conceiving that he should be protected under the
immunities of the Austrian ambassador. I summoned
the ambassador to my presence, in order to enquire into
the truth of the fact, and to inform him that it would be
most unfortunate if it were really such as it had been reported
to me. I observed that custom would be nothing
in my eyes when compared with the safety of a nation;
and that I would without hesitation order the arrest of
the criminal and his privileged protector, deliver them
both up to a tribunal, and subject them to the full penalties
of the law. And this I would have done, gentlemen,”
added he, raising his voice. “The ambassador was
aware of my determination, and therefore my wishes
were obeyed without further opposition.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Long before the expedition to Russia, perhaps a year
or two before it was undertaken, the Emperor wished to
establish a military classification of the Empire. At the
Council of State, there were read fifteen or twenty plans
for the organization of the three classes of the French
national guard. The first, which was to consist of young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>men, was to march as far as the frontiers; the second,
which was to be composed of middle-aged and married
men, was not to quit the department to which it belonged;
and the third, consisting of men in years, was to be
kept solely for the defence of the town in which it had
been raised. The Emperor, who was well convinced of
the utility of this plan, frequently recurred to it, and
made many patriotic remarks on the subject; but it constantly
received marked disapproval from the Council,
and experienced a kind of passive and silent opposition.
Meanwhile, amidst the multitude of public affairs which
claimed the attention of the Emperor, he lost sight of
this plan, which his foresight had doubtless calculated for
the safety of France, and which was likely to have ensured
that result. Upwards of two millions of men would
have been classed and armed at the period of our disasters.
Who then would have ventured to assail us?</p>

<p class='c001'>During a discussion on the above subject, the Emperor
spoke in a very emphatic and remarkable strain. A
member (M. Malouet), in a very circumlocutory style,
expressed his disapproval of this plan of organization.
The Emperor addressing him in his usual way, said:
“Speak boldly, sir, do not mutilate your ideas: say
what you have to say, freely; we are here by ourselves.”
The speaker then declared “that the measure was calculated
to excite general alarm; that every one trembled to
find himself classed in the national guard, being persuaded
that, under the pretext of internal defence, the object was
to remove the guard from the country.” “Very good!”
said the Emperor, “I now understand you. But, gentlemen,”
continued he, addressing himself to the members
of the Council, "you are all fathers of families, possessing
ample fortunes, and filling important posts, you
must necessarily have numerous dependents; and you
must either be very awkward, or very indifferent, if, with
all these advantages, you do not exercise a great influence
on public opinion. Now, how happens it that you, who
know me so well, should suffer me to be so little known
by others? When did you ever know me to employ deception
and fraud in my system of government? I am
not timid, and I therefore am not accustomed to resort to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>indirect measures. My fault is, perhaps, to express
myself too abruptly, too laconically. I merely pronounce
the word, I order, and, with regard to forms and details,
I trust to the intermediate agent who executes my intentions;
and heaven knows, whether, on this point, I
have any great reason to congratulate myself. If, therefore,
I wanted troops, I should boldly demand them of
the Senate, who would levy them for me; or if I could
not obtain them from the Senate, I should address myself
to the people, and you would see them eagerly march to
join my ranks. Perhaps you are astonished to hear me
say this, for sometimes you appear not to have a correct
idea of the real state of things. Know, then, that, my
popularity is immense, and incalculable; for, whatever
may be alleged to the contrary, the whole of the French
people love and respect me: their good sense is superior
to the malignant reports of my enemies and the metaphysical
speculations of fools. They would follow me in
defiance of all. You are surprised at these declarations,
but they are nevertheless true. The French people know
no benefactor but me. Through me they fearlessly enjoy
all that they have acquired; through me they behold
their brothers and sons indiscriminately promoted, honoured,
and enriched; through me they find their hands
constantly employed, and their labour accompanied by its
due reward. They have never had reason to accuse me
of injustice or prepossession. Now, the people see, feel
and comprehend all this; but they understand nothing
of metaphysics. Not that I am inclined to repel true
and great principles; heaven forbid that I should. On
the contrary, I act upon them as much as our present
extraordinary circumstances will permit; but I only mean
to say, that the people do not yet understand them; while
they perfectly understand me, and place implicit trust in
me. Be assured, then, that the people of France will
always conform to the plans which we propose for their
welfare.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not allow yourselves to be deceived by the supposed
opposition which has just been alluded to; it
exists only in the saloons of Paris, and by no means in
the great body of the nation. In this plan, I solemnly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>declare I have no ulterior view of sending the national
guard abroad; my thoughts, at this moment, are solely
occupied in adopting measures at home, for the safety,
repose, and stability of France. Proceed then to organize
the national guard; that each citizen may know
his post in the hour of need; that even M. Cambaceres,
yonder, may shoulder a musket, should our danger require
him so to do. We shall thus have a nation built of stone
and mortar, capable of resisting the attacks both of time
and men. I will moreover raise the national guard to a
level with the regiments of the line: the old retired officers
shall be the chiefs and the fathers of the corps. I
shall have promotion in the national guard solicited as
ardently as Court favours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All this must be contained in the registers of M. Locré,
partly in discussions relative to the national guard, and
partly, as well as I can recollect, on the subject of one
of the annual conscriptions. I remember that one day,
in particular, there was a long debate respecting the
University. The Emperor had expressed himself dissatisfied
with the little advancement that was observable
in the institution, and the bad system on which it was
conducted. M. Segur was directed to present a report
on this subject, which he did with his usual candour and
sincerity. He set on foot the necessary inquiries, and
found that the Emperor’s plans were ill understood and
badly executed. Napoleon had wished that erudition
should be only a secondary object, that national principles
and doctrines should take place of every thing; and
yet these principles and doctrines were the subjects to
which least attention was paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was not present at this sitting—a circumstance
which very much mortified the friends of the
person principally interested in the question. We were
guilty of sacrificing too much to the spirit of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coteries</em></span>.
The report was never again brought forward; it was
withdrawn from our portfolios, and it was made a point
of some importance to get it returned from those members
of the Council who had carried it home with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, some time after this, the great dignitaries
of the University were summoned to the bar of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Council of State. The Emperor expressed his displeasure
at the bad management and the bad spirit which
seemed to preside over this important institution. He
observed that all his intentions were frustrated, that his
plans were never properly carried into effect, &amp;c. M. de
F—— bent before the storm, and nevertheless pursued
his accustomed course. The Emperor said, on his return
from the Island of Elba, that he had been assured that
the Grand Master of the University had made a boast to
the government, which succeeded the Empire, of having
done all in his power to thwart and misdirect the impulse
which Napoleon wished to impart to the rising
generation.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>RECOLLECTIONS OF WATERLOO.</h3>

<p class='c007'>18th.—The Emperor sent for me to his study before
dinner; he was busy in reading the newspapers which
had just arrived. M. de Montholon solicited permission
to wait on him. He informed the Emperor that Madame
de Montholon had just been delivered of a daughter,
and requested his Majesty to do him the honour to
stand godfather to the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor again looked over the papers
which he had already perused, and remarked that
France still remained in a state of agitation and uncertainty:
he observed that the latest English papers used
the most indecorous language with regard to the royal
family.... One article led him to say: “Present
circumstances, the necessities of the moment, and
sympathies of old date, concur in favouring the return
of the monks to France. This is a characteristic circumstance
in France, as in the territories of the Pope.” Then,
dwelling on the subject of the latter, he continued, “as
for the Pope, it is his special affair, and is calculated to
restore his power. Would any one believe that, while
he was himself a prisoner at Fontainebleau, and while the
question of his own existence was under consideration,
he argued with me seriously on the existence of the
monks, and endeavoured to induce me to re-establish
them! That was truly like the Court of Rome!”</p>

<p class='c001'>This day was the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The circumstance was mentioned by some one present,
and the recollection of it produced a visible impression
on the Emperor. “Incomprehensible day!” said
he in a tone of sorrow—"Concurrence of unheard of
fatalities!—Grouchy!—Ney!—D’Erlon!—Was there
treachery, or only misfortune!—Alas! poor France!—"
Here he covered his eyes with his hands. “And yet,”
said he, “all that human skill could do was accomplished!
All was not lost until the moment when all
had succeeded!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A short time afterwards, alluding to the same subject,
he exclaimed; "in that extraordinary campaign, thrice,
in less than a week’s space, I saw the certain triumph
of France, and the decision of her fate slip through my
fingers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But for the desertion of a traitor, I should have annihilated
the enemy at the opening of the campaign. I
should have destroyed him at Ligny, if my left had done
its duty.—I should have destroyed him again at Waterloo,
if my right had not failed me. Singular defeat, by
which, notwithstanding the most fatal catastrophe, the
glory of the conquered has not suffered, nor the fame of
the conqueror been encreased: the memory of the one
will survive his destruction; the memory of the other
will perhaps be buried in his triumph!”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DEPARTURE OF THE NORTHUMBERLAND.—ON THE INTRODUCTION AND FORM GIVEN TO THE CAMPAIGNS OF ITALY.—THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN, BY AN AIDE-DE-CAMP OF THE VICEROY’S.</h3>

<p class='c007'>19th.—<a id='corr334.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='To day'>To-day</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_334.29'><ins class='correction' title='To day'>To-day</ins></a></span> the Northumberland sailed for Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>This vessel had conveyed us to St. Helena; we had
in the course of our voyage maintained a friendly intercourse
with the officers; the crew had shewn us great
kindness, and we had received attentions from Admiral
Cockburn himself, towards whom we entertained more
of ill-humour than absolute dislike, and whose conduct,
after all, had not been of a nature to wound our feelings.
Whether from all these circumstances combined, or some
others which had escaped our notice, or whether owing
to that powerful and natural inclination which leads us to
attach ourselves to our fellow creatures, and to cherish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>social feelings with regard to each other, I know not;
but it is certain that we did not feel indifferent to the
departure of the Northumberland. It seemed as though
we had lost something in thus bidding adieu to our old
shipmates.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor had passed a very bad night; he bathed
his feet to relieve a violent head-ache.</p>

<p class='c001'>About one o’clock he went to take a walk in the garden,
having in his hand the first volume of an English
work, respecting his own life. He turned it over as he
walked about. This work had evidently been written in
a less malignant spirit than Goldsmith’s. It certainly
exhibited less grossness; but it contained the same inventions,
the same false statements, and displayed the
same ignorance. The Emperor read the article relative
to his childhood, and that period of his early life which
he spent at College. The whole was a tissue of misrepresentation;
and this led him to remark that I had
been very right in suggesting that a narrative of the
events of his early career should be prefixed to the campaign
of Italy; and he added that what he had just read
had fully confirmed him in favour of this idea.</p>

<p class='c001'>I ought before to have mentioned that, after the dictation
of the campaigns of Italy was concluded, and after
it had all been arranged in chapters, the Emperor was
still undecided as to the manner in which he should form
an introduction to it. He had changed his mind frequently
on this subject, and had conceived many different
ideas, which he by turns abandoned and resumed.
Sometimes he was inclined to commence with a few unimportant
enterprises in which he had been engaged
before the siege of Toulon; such as an expedition to
Sardinia, which had failed, &amp;c. At other times he determined
to open the subject by describing the first events
of the French revolution, the state of Europe and the
movements of our armies. I always disapproved these
ideas, which, I conceived, would carry him back to too
remote a period. He had begun by dictating to me the
siege of Toulon, and this I maintained to be the proper
point of departure, and the most natural arrangement,
since he had not undertaken to write a history, but only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>his private Memoirs. In this grand episode of the history
of ages, he ought, I said, to appear all at once on
the theatre of the world, and to occupy the fore-ground
which he was destined never afterwards to quit. It was
my place, as editor, to record, in any introduction which
I might think proper to make, all the details of Napoleon’s
early life, and of the events anterior to the period
to which his own dictations referred. The Emperor approved
this idea; and after discussing it one day at dinner,
he decided on its adoption. The form that has been
given to the campaigns of Italy was determined on by
the above considerations, and to this subject the Emperor
alluded in his remark just mentioned, respecting the
introduction to the campaigns.</p>

<p class='c001'>At three o’clock, the governor and the new admiral,
Sir Pulteney Malcolm, were presented to the Emperor,
who, though labouring under indisposition, was nevertheless
very gracious and talkative.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both before and after dinner, the Emperor amused
himself by looking over a work on the Russian campaign,
written by an officer who had formerly been one of the
Viceroy’s aides-de-camp. The Emperor had heard it
described as a most odious production; but he has been
so accustomed to the attacks of libellers that declamation
has but little effect upon him. In works of this kind he
looks to facts only; and under this point of view he did
not find the publication in question so bad as it had been
represented to him. “An historian,” said he, “would
select from it only what is good; he would take the
facts and omit the declamation, which is only calculated
to please fools. The author of this work proves that the
Russians themselves burnt Moscow, Smolensko, &amp;c.; he
describes the French as having been victorious in every engagement.
The facts that are to be found in this work,”
continued the Emperor, "have evidently been described
for the purpose of being published during my reign, in
the period of my power. The declamatory passages have
been interpolated since my fall. The author could not
easily pervert the ground-work of his subject, though he
has interspersed it with abusive remarks after the fashion
of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“As to the disasters of my retreat, I left him nothing
to say any more than other libellers. My 29th bulletin
plunged them into despair. In their rage they accused
me of exaggeration. They were provoked to a pitch of
madness. I thus deprived them of an excellent subject,
I carried off their prey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor quoted several passages from the works
of this and some other French authors, all of whom
declaimed against their countrymen, and gave a false
picture of their achievements. He could not refrain
from observing that it was a circumstance unexampled
in history to see a nation strive to depreciate her own
glory, to see her own sons thus intent on destroying her
trophies. “But from the bosom of France avengers will
doubtless arise. Posterity will brand with disgrace the
madness of the present day. Can these be Frenchmen,”
he exclaimed, “who speak and write in this strain? Are
their hearts dead to every spark of patriotism?—But no,
they cannot be Frenchmen! They speak our language, it
is true; they were born on the same soil with us; but
they are not animated by the feelings and principles of
Frenchmen!”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PROPHETIC REMARKS.—LORD HOLLAND.—THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE OF WALES.—CONVERSATION RELATING TO MYSELF.</h3>

<p class='c007'>21st.—The Emperor took a walk in the garden attended
by his suite. The conversation turned on the possibility
of our returning to Europe and seeing France once
more. “My dear friends,” said he, in a tone of sincere
feeling, and with an expression which it is impossible to
describe, “you will return!”—"Not without you," we
all exclaimed with one voice. This led us once more to
analyze the probable chances of our quitting St. Helena,
and all yielded to the necessity of admitting that our
removal could only take place through the intervention
of the English. But the Emperor could not imagine
how this intervention was likely to be brought about.
“The impression is made,” said he; “it has taken too
deep a root; they will everlastingly fear me. Pitt told
them, There can be no safety for you, with a man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>has a whole invasion in his single head.” “But,” observed
some one present, “suppose new interests should
arise in England; suppose a truly constitutional and
liberal ministry should be established, would the English
government find no advantage in fixing through you,
Sire, liberal principles in France, and thereby propagating
them throughout Europe?” “Certainly,” replied
the Emperor, “I admit all this.” “Well then,” continued
the individual who had first spoken, “would not
this constitutional administration find a guarantee in
these liberal principles and in your own interests?” “I
admit this also,” replied the Emperor. "I can suppose
Lord Holland, as Prime Minister of England, writing to
me at Paris: If you do so and so I shall be ruined; or
the Princess Charlotte of Wales, whom we will suppose
to have removed me hence, saying to me: If you act
thus, I shall be hated and shall be looked upon as the
scourge of my country. At these words I should stop
short:—they would arrest me in my career more
effectually than armies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And after all, what is there to fear? That I should
wage war? I am now too old for that. Is it feared that
I should resume my pursuit of glory? I have enjoyed
glory even to satiety. I have wallowed in it; and it
may be said to be a thing which I have henceforth rendered
at once common and difficult. Is it supposed that
I would recommence my conquests? I did not persevere
in them through mania; they were the result of a great
plan, and I may even say that I was urged to them by
necessity. They were reasonable at the moment when I
pursued them; but they would now be impossible. They
were practicable once; but now it would be madness to
attempt them. And besides, the convulsions and misfortunes
to which France has been subjected will henceforth
produce so many difficulties, that to remove them
will be a sufficient source of glory without seeking for
any other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Two of the gentlemen of the Emperor’s suite had been
to the town to see the persons who had newly arrived at
the Island, and to hear the news of the day. The account
which they delivered on their return occupied the Emperor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>attention for some minutes in the garden. About
six o’clock he proceeded to his closet, desiring me to
follow him; and by chance a conversation was introduced,
which to me was in the highest degree interesting
and valuable. Though the subject of this conversation
relates to myself personally, yet I cannot pass it over
in silence; it develops so many characteristic traits
of the Emperor, that these would furnish a sufficient
apology for my laying it before the reader, were any
apology necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The persons who had arrived by the Newcastle had
spoken much of my Historical Atlas, which led the Emperor
again to remark on the extraordinary celebrity of
the work, and to express his surprise that he should
not sooner have become thoroughly acquainted with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How happened it,” said he, “that none of your
friends should have given me a correct idea of it? I
never saw it until I was on board the Northumberland,
and now I find it is known to every body. How came
you never to call my attention to it yourself? I should
have appreciated your merits, and should have made
your fortune. I had formed a confused and indifferent
idea of your work, which perhaps influenced my mind
unfavourably with respect to yourself. Such is the
misfortune of Sovereigns; for doubtless no one entertained
better intentions than myself. Those who filled
posts about my person might easily have brought me to
render full justice to the merit of your work; for it was
a thing that I could myself judge of, and I asked nothing
more. Since I have become acquainted with your tables,
and am enabled to form a correct notion of their valuable
classification, and the indelible impression which they
are calculated to make on the memory, with regard to
dates, places, and collateral relations, I regret not having
established a kind of Normal School, in which the
students should have been uniformly instructed by the
help of the Historical Atlas. Our Lyceums would have
been inundated with your work, or parts of it, and I
would have ensured to it the utmost degree of celebrity.
Why, I say again, did you not call my attention to it?
It is painful to confess the secret; but it is nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>true, that a little intrigue is indispensable to those who
wish to gain the favour of Sovereigns; modest merit is
almost always neglected. But, perhaps, after all, Clarke,
Decrès, Montalivet, M. de Montesquiou, or even Barbier,
my librarian, might have withheld the hints which you
intended they should throw out to me; for it is another
mortifying truth, that favours are sometimes more
attainable through the medium of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>valet-de-chambre</em></span>
than by a higher channel! And how happened it, that
your friend Madame de S.... did not speak
to me of your work? We frequently rode in the same
carriage together; and she might have secured to you
all the advantages she could have wished, by describing
your real merits to me.”—"Yes, Sire," I replied, “but
at that time I....” “I understand you. You
did not then perhaps seek favours?” “Sire, my hour
had not yet arrived.” Then ensued a very long explanation
respecting my first introduction to the Emperor, the
missions to which he had appointed me, the opinion
which he had formed of me, and which, according to
custom, had remained permanently fixed in his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this time I was standing near the writing-table in
the second chamber, while the Emperor walked backward
and forward through the whole length of both
rooms. The subject of the conversation was to me most
interesting. But, to form a just conception of my feelings
at this moment, it would be necessary to look back
to the time of Napoleon’s power, to that period when no
one dared hope to know his thoughts, or ever to suppose
the possibility of conversing familiarly and confidentially
with him. Such a happy circumstance would then have
appeared to me a dream: and now I almost regard it as
a conversation in the Elysian Fields.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had no correct idea of you,” said the Emperor,
"I had no precise knowledge of anything that concerned
you. You had no friend near me to commend you to
my notice, and you neglected to put yourself forward.
Some of those persons on whom perhaps you thought
you could rely even acted in a way prejudicial to your
interest. I knew nothing of your work; if I had, it
would have been a powerful circumstance in your favour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>I was not aware that you had, like myself, attended the
military school at Paris; that would have been another
claim to my notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had been an emigrant, you would therefore
never have enjoyed my full confidence. I knew that
you had been much attached to the Bourbons; you
would therefore never have been initiated in the great
secrets of my government.”—"But Sire," I replied,
“your Majesty permitted me to approach your person,
you made me a Councillor of State, and entrusted me
with various missions.”—"That was because I conceived
you to be an honest man; and besides, I am not of a
distrustful disposition. Without knowing why, I considered
you to be a man of pure integrity in all that
regarded pecuniary matters. If you had only mentioned
a single word to me about your affair of the commercial
licenses with P....[——?], I would have instantly
rendered you justice. But, I say again, I should never
have employed you in any political affair."—"Then,
Sire," said I, “what risk did I not run, when in Paris
and Holland! The English were then situated with respect
to us, as we now are with respect to them, and, influenced
by my old connections, I ventured in spite of your regulations
to forward their letters, when they appeared to me
to contain nothing objectionable. To what danger
should I not have been exposed had my conduct led to
any accusation on the part of the Minister of Police!
And yet I conceived that I was only making a very
natural and discretionary use of the powers with which
Your Majesty had entrusted me, and the confidence
which you had reposed in me. I felt so satisfied in my
own conscience, and was so convinced of the propriety
of my intentions, that I thought myself exempt from the
observance of regulations which seemed not to have
been made for me.”—"Well," observed the Emperor,
“I could have conceived all this, I should readily have
given you credit for such an explanation of your conduct;
for no one is more ready to listen to reason than
I. This was precisely the manner in which I wished
duty to be performed; and yet it is certain that you
would have been condemned had your conduct been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>subject of enquiry, because all would have raised their
voices against you. Such was the fatality of circumstances
and the misfortune of my situation. Besides,
when once I conceived a prejudice, I retained it: this
again was the misfortune of my situation and my circumstances.
But how could it be otherwise? I had no
time for details. I could only take into consideration
summaries and abstracts. I was very sure that I might
sometimes be deceived; but where was my alternative?
Few sovereigns have done better than I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” said I, “I experienced deep mortification, at
finding that your Majesty never addressed a word to me
at your Court circles and levees. And yet you never
failed to speak of me to my wife when I happened to be
absent: I sometimes thought that I was not well known
to you, or feared, particularly during later times, that
your Majesty had some cause to be displeased with me.”—"By
no means," resumed the Emperor; “if I spoke
of you when absent, it was because I made it a rule
always to speak to ladies about their husbands when the
latter were sent on missions. If I neglected you when
present, it was because I attached too little value to you.
It was the same with many other individuals; you were
confounded with the mass, you held only an ordinary
rank in my regard. You were permitted to approach
me, and yet you did not turn this privilege to good account;
you were sent on missions, and yet you neglected
to reap the benefit of these appointments on your return
home. It is a great fault to keep in the back-ground at
court. To my eyes you were in fact a mere blank.
Nevertheless, I recollect that I sometimes entertained
thoughts of employing you. The person connected with
the ministry, on whom you in some measure depended,
who declared himself to be your friend, and who had it
in his power to serve you, diverted my attention from
you, and contributed to keep up my indifference towards
you. He knew you well, and perhaps feared you; and
it is well known that in all cases I went rapidly to
work.”—"Sire," I replied, “my situation was the more
painful, since my friends were constantly congratulating
me on the favours which I received at Court, and predicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the brilliant fortune that awaited me. Reports
were continually raised of my having been appointed to
all sorts of posts:—sometimes it was asserted that I had
been created Maritime Prefect of Brest, Toulon, or
Antwerp; that I had been made Minister of the Interior
or of the Marine; or that I had received an important
trust connected with the education of the King of Rome,
&amp;c.”—"Well," said the Emperor, “now that you call
the matter to my recollection, some of these reports were
not entirely destitute of foundation. I certainly did
entertain the idea of employing you to assist in the
education of the King of Rome; and I also intended, on
your return to Holland, to appoint you to be Maritime
Prefect of Toulon, which at that time I regarded as a
sort of ministry. There were five-and-twenty ships of
the line in the roads, and I wished to augment their
number. In this instance, your friend, the Minister,
turned my attention from you. You belonged to the old
navy, he observed; your prejudices and those of the new
officers must inevitably clash together. This appeared
to me a decided objection to your appointment, and I
thought no more about you; but now, since I have come
to know you, I find that you were precisely the man I
wanted. I think, too, that I entertained some other ideas
respecting your advancement; but I must again repeat
that you neglected your own interests. You retreated
when you ought to have advanced. Need I tell you
that, with the best intentions on my part, the chance
against procuring an appointment to an important post
was as great as that of winning a prize in the lottery.
An idea occurred to me, and I formed my decision; but
if that decision were not immediately carried into effect,
it escaped my recollection; for I had so much business
on my hands. A luckier candidate was then proposed,
and he was installed in office.—But I interrupt
you....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire,” continued I, "being ignorant of your Majesty’s
kind intentions respecting me, I was placed in a situation
truly ridiculous, amidst the numerous congratulations
that I received. I endeavoured to extricate myself
from all this embarrassment with the best possible grace;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>but the more efforts I made for this purpose, the more I
was blamed for my modesty. I never asked your Majesty
for more than one thing, and that was the situation
of Master of Requests, which was immediately granted
to me. Clarke reproached me with having lowered my
dignity by making such a solicitation. He said that I
should have asked to be made a Councillor of State; and
that your Majesty would have granted my request."—"No,"
replied the Emperor, “I did not know you well
enough for that. I should have looked upon such a
request as the result of silly ambition.”—" Sire," I observed,
“I had sufficient tact to guess what your opinion
would be.”—"Well,“ continued the Emperor, that was
odd enough. But perhaps Clarke was right after all. The
solicitation of the inferior post of Master of Requests
might have injured you in my opinion; that is to say, it
might have tended to fix you in the rank in which I had
classed you. I was very well pleased to see my chamberlains
have something to do; but Master of Requests was
too trivial a post. It is curious,” continued he, “how
my memory revives, now that I am speaking on this subject.
You had performed detached services, which had
rapidly escaped my recollection, because my attention had
never been directed to them. If they had been presented
to my notice all in a mass, they must have given me a
very different opinion of you. You served as a volunteer
at Flushing. I knew this; and what I should have
regarded as a mere matter of course in any other individual,
forcibly struck me in an emigrant, who had for this
purpose quitted his family, and who was not without
fortune.”—"Sire, I received the most gratifying reward
on my return. Your Majesty spoke to me on the subject."—"But,"
said he, “you suffered this to be lost in
the flood of oblivion. You addressed several written
communications to me. All these things occur to my recollection
by degrees. You transmitted to me some plans
respecting the Adriatic Sea, with which I was much
pleased. The suggestion was to get possession of the
Adriatic, and to establish a fleet there. Ships could
have been built at no vast expense, with the wood produced
in the immense forests of Croatia. I submitted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>whole to the Minister, who never more mentioned the
subject to me. But you presented some other things to
my notice.”—"Sire, you probably allude to the ideas respecting
the system of maritime warfare to be adopted
against England, accompanied by an explanatory map."—"Yes,
I recollect. The map lay for several days on
the desk in my closet. I expressed a wish to see you;
but you were absent on a mission."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sire, about the same time I had the honour to address
to you a plan for transforming the Champ-de-Mars
into a <em>Naumachia</em>, which would have been an ornament
to the palace of the King of Rome. I proposed that the
basin should be dug sufficiently deep to admit the
launching of small corvettes, which might have been
built, rigged, manned and worked by the pupils of the
naval school, which, according to my plan, was to be
established at the military school. All the Princes of
the Imperial house might have been required to devote
themselves to these naval exercises for the space of two
years, whatever might have been their ultimate destination.
Your Majesty might have induced the distinguished
families of the empire thus to procure for their
sons a knowledge of naval affairs. I doubted not that
all these circumstances combined, and the spectacle
presented to the capital, would infallibly have rendered
the navy at once popular and national in France.”—"Ah!
I was not aware of the extent of your plan,"
said the Emperor, in whose mind every idea immediately
became magnified. “This design would have pleased
me. It might have produced immense results. From
this plan there was but a step to that of rendering the
Seine navigable, and cutting a canal from Paris to the
sea. This could not have been regarded as too stupendous
an enterprise; for more was done by the Romans
in ancient times, and more has already been effected by
the Chinese of the present day. It would have afforded
a pastime to the army in time of peace. I had conceived
many plans of the same kind. But our enemies kept me
chained to war. Of what glory have they robbed me!...
But continue.”—</p>

<p class='c001'>"Sire, I also submitted to your Majesty’s consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>some ideas respecting the completion of the naval
schools."—"Did I adopt them in the schools which I
established?" inquired the Emperor. “Did your opinions
coincide with mine?” “Sire, the plans for your schools
were already determined on; I merely suggested a few
hints for their completion.”—"Oh, now I recollect
something of the matter. But I think your ideas were
a little too democratic; were they not?"—"No, Sire, I
set out from the principle that your Majesty had provided
for the exclusive competition of the intermediate
class, and I proposed to add below it all the chances
that might be presented by the competition of seamen;
and above it, all the chances that might arise out of the
competition of individuals connected with the Court."—"Yes,
I recollect," said the Emperor, "your ideas were
novel and singular, and they attracted my attention. I
submitted the plan to the Minister, who either kept it
for his own use, or turned it into ridicule. I also remember
that, in the correspondence relative to your
mission to Holland, which I ordered to be laid before
me, there was mentioned a plan for removing our ships
from the German Ocean to the Baltic, by means of
canals, which should unite the Elbe, the Oder, and the
Vistula. This idea pleased me; it was after my own
taste. And on your return, seeing you at my levee, I
was about to propose to you some measure for the
execution of your plan. But you did not seem to comprehend
my questions, or you gave me unsatisfactory
and undecided answers. I concluded that the ideas had
probably been suggested by some one else, and that you
were taking credit for them. I therefore left you, and
turned to speak to your neighbour. I was to blame
for acting thus precipitately; but I could not help it.</p>

<p class='c001'>"When I call to mind all these circumstances, I find
that I had so many motives for bestowing attention on
you, that I am astonished I should have neglected you:
and I cannot help thinking that you must have man&oelig;uvred
admirably, before you could have succeeded in
withdrawing yourself so completely from my notice. It
is very certain that all these facts have but just now
occurred to me: and at the period of our departure, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>some time afterwards, you were, with the exception of
your name and person, a stranger to me. I looked upon
you as one of whom I knew nothing. How do you
account for this? You cannot perhaps explain it; but it
is nevertheless true.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ask again, why you did not avail yourself of the
good offices of your friends; or why you did not appeal
to me in person?”—"Sire, those who enjoyed the
privilege of approaching nearest to your person were
intent only on advancing their own interests. Their
friendship did not extend beyond mere good wishes. To
speak a word for another was what they called using
their influence; and that was reserved solely for their
own advantage. Besides, even though I had had the
opportunity of speaking for myself, I should always have
preferred others to speak for me. You, Sire, had but
little leisure, your arrangements were very uncertain, it
was necessary to explain every thing to you in few
words. At the same time, I had so little confidence in
myself, and was so fearful of creating an unfavourable
impression, that I preferred withdrawing myself from
your notice. For it was not sufficient to enter into
intrigue; it was necessary that the intrigue should be
brought to a result."—"Perhaps it was as well after
all," said the Emperor. “You have judged the matter
rightly; for, even had I known as much of you as I now
do, your reserve and timidity would perhaps have ruined
you. I now recollect a circumstance, which probably
operated to your prejudice. When M. de Montesquiou
proposed you as Chamberlain, he represented you as
being possessed of vast fortune; but I soon learned the
contrary. I do not mean to say that this circumstance
was in any way injurious to you, or that it afforded any
ground of objection to you personally; but other individuals,
who wished to be appointed Chamberlains,
complained of not having been preferred on account of
their superior fortune, or quoted your example, if they
thought themselves neglected on the score of their
poverty. This is the way at Court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It appears evident, Sire, that, with my character, I
was destined never to be known to your Majesty.”—"Yes,“
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>said the Emperor and it had nearly happened
so. But yet, on my return, did I not appoint you a
Chamberlain? and their number was very limited. Did
I not immediately create you a Councillor of State? You
had been a member of the old aristocracy, you had been
an emigrant, and you had undergone great trials; all
these were powerful recommendations to me. Besides,
at that time, so many voices were raised in praise of your
conduct that, sooner or later, I must have known you
thoroughly.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ARRIVAL OF THE LIBRARY.—HORNEMANN’S TESTIMONY<br /> IN FAVOUR OF GENERAL BONAPARTE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>22nd.—To-day the weather was very bad. The Emperor
sent for me about three o’clock. He was in the
topographical cabinet, surrounded by all the persons of
his suite, who were engaged in unpacking some boxes of
books which had arrived by the Newcastle. The Emperor
himself helped to unpack, and seemed to be highly
amused with the occupation. Men naturally adapt
themselves to their circumstances: their enjoyments are
trivial in proportion as their sufferings are severe. On
seeing the file of Moniteurs, which had been so long expected,
he expressed unfeigned delight: he took it up
and began eagerly to peruse it.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner the Emperor looked over Park’s and
Hornemann’s Travels in Africa, and he traced their
course on my Atlas. In these narratives, Hornemann,
and the African Society of London, bore ample testimony
to the generous assistance they had received from the
General-in-chief of the army of Egypt (Napoleon), who
had seized every opportunity of promoting their discoveries.
The polite and handsome manner in which these
facts were mentioned was very gratifying to the Emperor,
who had been long accustomed to find his name
connected with insulting epithets.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ON MEMORY.—TRADE.—NAPOLEON’S IDEAS AND PLANS<br /> ON SEVERAL POINTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>23rd.—I attended the Emperor about three o’clock.
He had been so delighted at the receipt of his new books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>that he had passed the whole night in reading and dictating
notes to Marchand. He was very much fatigued;
but my visit afforded him a little respite. He dressed
and went out to walk in the garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>During dinner the Emperor alluded to his immense
reading in his youth; and he found, from all the books
he had perused relative to Egypt, that he had scarcely
any thing to correct in what he had dictated on Egypt:
he had stated many facts which he had not read, but
which, on reference to these books, he found to be
correct.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation turned on the subject of memory.
The Emperor remarked that a head without memory
was like a garrison without fortifications. His he said
was a useful kind of memory. It was not general and
absolute; but relative, faithful, and only retentive of
what was necessary. Some one present observed that
his own memory was like his sight, that it became confused
by the distance of places and objects, as he removed
from one situation to another; upon which the Emperor
replied that, for his part, his memory was like his heart,
that it preserved a faithful impression of all that ever
had been dear to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>A-propos of good memory and fond recollections, I
must here note down a remark of the Emperor’s, which
I omitted to mention at the time it was made. One
day at dinner, while describing one of his engagements
in Egypt, he named numerically the eight or ten demi-brigades
which had been engaged. On hearing this,
Madame Bertrand could not refrain from asking how,
after so long a time, he could possibly recollect all these
numbers. "Madame, this is a lover’s recollection of his
former mistresses," was Napoleon’s reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor ordered my Atlas to be
brought to him, for the purpose of verifying the particulars
which he had collected in his books on Africa,
and he was astonished to find every thing correspond so
accurately.</p>

<p class='c001'>He then began to converse on trade, and the principles
and systems which he had introduced. He opposed
the principles of economists, which he said were correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>in theory, though erroneous in their application. The
political constitution of different states, continued he,
must render these principles defective; local circumstances
continually call for deviations from their uniformity.
Duties, he said, which were so severely condemned by
political economists, should not, it is true, be an object
to the exchequer: they should be the guarantee and protection
of a nation, and should correspond with the
nature and the objects of its trade. Holland, which is
destitute of productions and manufactures, and which
has a trade only of transit and commission, should be free
from all fetters and barriers. France, on the contrary,
which is rich in every sort of production and manufactures,
should incessantly guard against the importations
of a rival, who might still continue superior to her, and
also against the cupidity, egotism, and indifference of
mere brokers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have not fallen into the error of modern systematizers,”
said the Emperor, "who imagine that all the
wisdom of nations is centered in themselves. Experience
is the true wisdom of nations. And what does all
the reasoning of economists amount to? They incessantly
extol the prosperity of England, and hold her up
as our model; but the Custom-House system is more
burthensome and arbitrary in England than in any
other country. They also condemn prohibitions; yet it
was England that set the example of prohibitions, and
they are in fact necessary with regard to certain objects.
Duties cannot adequately supply the place of prohibitions:
there will always be found means to defeat the object of
the legislator. In France we are still very far behind
on these delicate points, which are still unperceived or
ill-understood by the mass of society. Yet what advancement
have we not made! What correctness of
ideas has been introduced by my gradual classification of
agriculture, industry, and trade; objects so distinct in
themselves, and which present so great and positive a
graduation!</p>

<p class='c001'>"1st.—<em>Agriculture</em>; the soul, the first basis of the
empire.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>"2nd.—<em>Industry</em>; the comfort and happiness of the
population.</p>

<p class='c001'>"3rd.—<em>Foreign trade</em>; the superabundance, the
proper application of the surplus of agriculture and
industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Agriculture was continually improving during the
whole course of the Revolution. Foreigners thought it
ruined in France. In 1814, however, the English were
compelled to admit that we had little or nothing to learn
from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Industry or manufactures, and internal trade, made
immense progress during my reign. The application of
chemistry to the manufactures caused them to advance
with giant strides. I gave an impulse, the effects of
which extended throughout Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Foreign trade, which in its results is infinitely inferior
to agriculture, was an object of subordinate importance
in my mind. Foreign trade is made for agriculture
and home industry, and not the two latter for the
former. The interests of these three fundamental bases
are diverging and frequently conflicting. I always promoted
them in their natural gradation; but I could not,
and ought not to have ranked them all on an equality.
Time will unfold what I have done, the national resources
which I created, and the emancipation from the English
which I brought about. We have now the secret of the
commercial treaty of 1783. France still exclaims against
its author; but the English demanded it on pain of
resuming the war. They wished to do the same after
the treaty of Amiens; but I was then all-powerful; I
was a hundred cubits high. I replied that if they were
in possession of the heights of Montmartre I would still
refuse to sign the treaty. These words were echoed
through Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The English will now impose some such treaty on
France, at least if popular clamour, and the opposition
of the mass of the nation, do not force them to draw
back. This thraldom would be an additional disgrace in
the eyes of that nation, which is now beginning to acquire
a just perception of her own interests.</p>

<p class='c001'>"When I came to the head of the government, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>American ships, which were permitted to enter our ports
on the score of their neutrality, brought us raw materials,
and had the impudence to sail from France without
freight, for the purpose of taking in cargoes of English
goods in London. They moreover had the insolence to
make their payments, when they had any to make, by
giving bills on persons in London. Hence the vast
profits reaped by the English manufacturers and brokers,
entirely to our prejudice. I made a law that no American
should import goods to any amount, without immediately
exporting their exact equivalent. A loud outcry
was raised against this: it was said that I had ruined
trade. But what was the consequence? Notwithstanding
the closing of my ports, and in spite of the English
who ruled the seas, the Americans returned and submitted
to my regulations. What might I not have done
under more favourable circumstances?</p>

<p class='c001'>"Thus I naturalized in France the manufacture of
cotton, which includes:—</p>

<p class='c001'>"1st. <em>Spun-cotton.</em>—We did not previously spin it
ourselves; the English supplied us with it as a sort
of favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>"2nd. <em>The woven-stuff.</em>—We did not yet make it;
it came to us from abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>"3rd. <em>The printing.</em>—This was the only part of the
manufacture that we performed ourselves. I wished to
naturalize the two first branches; and I proposed to the
Council of State that their importation should be prohibited.
This excited great alarm. I sent for Oberkamp,
and I conversed with him a long time. I learned from
him that this prohibition would doubtless produce a shock,
but that, after a year or two of perseverance, it would
prove a triumph, from which we should derive immense
advantages. Then I issued my decree in spite of all;
this was a true piece of statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I at first confined myself merely to prohibiting wove-cottons;
then I extended the prohibition to spun cotton;
and we now possess within ourselves the three branches
of the cotton manufacture, to the great benefit of our
population, and the injury and regret of the English:—which
proves that, in civil government as well as in war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>decision of character is often indispensable to success.
I offered a million of francs as a reward for the discovery
of a method of spinning flax like cotton, and this discovery
would undoubtedly have been made,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a> but for our
unfortunate circumstances. I should then have prohibited
cotton, if I could not have naturalized it on the
continent.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The encouragement of the production of silk was an
object that equally claimed my attention. As Emperor
of France and King of Italy I calculated on receiving an
annual revenue of 120 millions from the production
of silk.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The system of commercial licenses was no doubt
mischievous! Heaven forbid that I should have laid it
down as a principle. It was the invention of the English;
with me it was only a momentary resource. Even
the continental system, in its extent and rigour, was by
me regarded merely as a measure occasioned by the war
and temporary circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The difficulties, and even the total stagnation, of
foreign trade during my reign arose out of the force of
circumstances and the accidents of the time. One brief
interval of peace would immediately have restored it to
its natural level.”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ARTILLERY.—ITS USE.—ITS DEFECTS.—OLD SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>24th.—The Emperor informed us that he had spent
full four-and-twenty hours in reading the Moniteur on
the subject of the Constituent Assembly. He said that
he had found these accounts as amusing as a romance;
they mark the first rise of those men who had, at a
later period, played so distinguished a part. However,
he said, it was necessary to have an idea of the external
springs of action, otherwise the reports of the proceedings
of the Constituent Assembly lost much of their
interest, and were frequently unintelligible. The spirit of
the first moments, the first interests, of the Revolution
remained entirely hidden.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner the Emperor conversed on the subject of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Artillery. He had wished for more uniformity and less
of subdivision in the pieces. The general was often
unable to judge of the best mode of employing them,
and nothing could be superior to the advantages of uniformity
in all the instruments and <a id='corr354.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='accessaries'>accessories</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_354.5'><ins class='correction' title='accessaries'>accessories</ins></a></span> of war.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor observed that in general the artillery
did not fire sufficiently in a battle. The principal consideration
in war is that there should be no want of
ammunition. When there is an actual scarcity, of course,
that forms an exception; but, in every other case, it is
necessary to fire incessantly. The Emperor, who had
himself often been nearly killed by spent balls, and who
knew how important such an event would have been to
the fate of the battle or the campaign, maintained the
propriety of firing continually, without calculating expense.
Moreover, he said, that if he wished to avoid
the post of danger, he would station himself at the distance
of 300 toises, rather than at 600. At the first-mentioned
point, the balls frequently pass over the head;
but at the latter they must fall somewhere or other.</p>

<p class='c001'>He remarked, that it was impossible to make artillery
fire on masses of infantry, when they were themselves
assailed by an opposite battery. This arises from natural
cowardice, said he, good-humouredly, from the irresistible
instinct of self-preservation. An artillery-officer who
was among us protested against this observation.—"It
is nevertheless true," continued the Emperor; “you immediately
stand on your guard against the enemy who
attacks you. You seek to destroy him, lest he should
destroy you. You often desist from firing, that he may
cease to harass you, and direct his charge against the
masses of infantry, who are of much greater importance
to the fate of the battle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor frequently adverted to the corps of artillery,
in which he had served in his youth. He said that
it was the best constituted corps in Europe. It was a
sort of family service. The officers were quite of a
paternal turn, the bravest and worthiest men in the world,
pure as gold. They were somewhat too far advanced
in life, because the peace had continued too long.
The young men laughed at them, because sarcasm and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>irony were the fashion of the day; but they adored them,
and never failed to render justice to their merits.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>25th.—We have received the third and last package
of books brought by the frigate. The Emperor has
greatly fatigued himself by assisting to unpack and
arrange them.</p>

<p class='c001'>About three o’clock, several persons were presented to
the Emperor; among others, the Admiral and his lady.
The Emperor was indisposed, and he dined in his own
chamber, attended by the Grand Marshal.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>CAMPAIGN OF ITALY.—THE EMPEROR’S OPINION OF GENERAL<br /> <br /></h3>
<p class='c007'>DROUOT.—ON THE BATTLE OF HOHENLINDEN.</p>

<p class='c001'>26th.—The Emperor sent for me and my son, and set
us to look over the Moniteur, for the purpose of comparing
and completing the manuscript of the Campaigns
of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, though he had announced his intention
of doing so, had not yet resumed his dictations, and I
rejoiced at a circumstance which promised at length to
excite renewed interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our business was to select from the Moniteur all the
reports and official letters, for the purpose of vouchers.
The Emperor wished them to be properly classed, and
desired us to make an estimate of their extent, in order
that he might be able to calculate at once the space they
would occupy when printed, reminding me at the same
time that these were henceforth my own affairs; that I
should only be serving myself for the future. Delightful
words, to which the tone of his voice, his familiar air,
and his whole expression, imparted even more value than
was conveyed in their meaning!</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day, during dinner, the Emperor again reviewed
the character of his Generals. He passed an eulogium
on several of them, the greater number of whom are now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>no more. He bestowed the highest praise on the talents
of General Drouot. Every thing in life is a problem,
said he; it is only by what is known that we can come
at what is unknown. He observed that he knew to a
certainty that General Drouot possessed every quality
necessary to make a great General. He had sufficient
reasons for supposing him superior to many of his Marshals.
He had no hesitation in believing him capable of
commanding 100,000 men. “And perhaps,” added he,
“he was far from thinking so himself, which, after all,
can only be regarded as an additional good quality.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He again alluded to the prodigious valour of Murat
and Ney, whose courage, he said, so often outstripped
their judgment. Such is the enigma, said he, of certain
actions in certain individuals: the inequality between
disposition and understanding explains all.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation turned on the battle of Hohenlinden.
The Emperor remarked that “it was one of those
great triumphs that are brought about by chance, and
obtained without plan. Moreau, he repeated, was destitute
of invention; he was not sufficiently decided;
and, therefore, he was most fit to be employed on the
defensive. Hohenlinden was a confused sort of affair;
the enemy had been unexpectedly attacked amidst his
own operations, and was conquered by troops whom he
had already broken and nearly destroyed. The merit
rested chiefly with the troops and generals of the partial
corps, who had been most exposed to danger, and who
had fought like heroes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When speaking of the campaigns of Italy, we observed
to the Emperor that the rapid succession of his
daily victories, which filled the mouth of fame, must
have been a source of great delight to him.—"By no
means," replied he. “At least they were supposed to
have been so by those who were at a distance from the
scene of conflict.”—"That may be; those who were at
a distance knew only our success; they knew nothing of
our situation. If those victories could have procured
me pleasure, I should have enjoyed repose. But I had
always the aspect of danger before me, and the victory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>of to-day was speedily forgotten through the obligation
of gaining another to-morrow."</p>

<p class='c001'>I recollect having heard a distinguished General (Lamarque)
deliver a very characteristic opinion of Moreau.
Lamarque had been much attached to Moreau, and had
for a long time served under him. He was endeavouring
to make me understand the different tactics of Moreau
and Napoleon. He said:—"Had their two armies
been in presence, and there had been sufficient time to
move, I would have entered the ranks of Moreau, which
were sure to be managed with the utmost regularity,
precision, and calculation. On these points, it was impossible
to excel, or even to equal, Moreau. But if the
two armies had to approach from points a hundred
leagues distant from each other, the Emperor would
have routed his adversary three, four, or five times over,
before the latter could have had time to look about
him."</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ANNOYANCE FROM RATS.—LORD CASTLEREAGH’S IMPOSTURES.—FRENCH<br /> HEIRESSES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Thursday, 27th.—We had nearly gone without our
breakfast: an incursion of the rats, which had entered
our kitchen from several points, during the night, had
deprived us of every thing eatable. We are much infested
with these vermin; they are of enormous size,
and very daring and mischievous; it took them very
little time to penetrate our walls and floors. Attracted
by the smell of the victuals, they even made their way
into our drawing-room whilst we were at dinner. We
were several times obliged to give them battle after the
dessert; and one evening, when the Emperor wished to
retire, and his hat was handed to him, a rat of the
largest size jumped out of it. Our grooms had tried to
rear some poultry, but they were compelled to abandon
the attempt, because the rats devoured all the fowls.
They would even seize them in the night on their
perches.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was this day translating some review
or journal, in which it was mentioned that Lord Castlereagh
had asserted at a public meeting that Napoleon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>even since his fall, had not hesitated to declare that, so
long as he should have reigned, he would have continued
to make war against England, having never had any
object but that of her destruction.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor could not help feeling provoked by
these words. “Lord Castlereagh,” said he, with indignation,
“must be much accustomed to lying, and
must place great dependence on the credulity of his
auditors. Can their own good sense allow them to believe
that I could ever make such a foolish speech, even
if I had had such intentions!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was afterwards stated that Lord Castlereagh had
said, in parliament, that the reason why the French
army was so much attached to Bonaparte was that he
made a kind of conscription of all the heiresses of the
empire, and then distributed them amongst his generals.
“Here again,” observed the Emperor, “Lord Castlereagh
tells a wilful falsehood. He came amongst us;
he had an opportunity of seeing our manners and laws,
and of knowing the truth; he must be certain that such
a thing was quite impracticable and out of my power.
What does he take our nation for? The French were
never capable of submitting to such tyranny. I have,
no doubt, made a great number of matches; and I
would gladly have made thousands more; it was one of
the most effectual methods of amalgamating and uniting
irreconcileable factions. If I had had more time to myself,
I would have taken great pains to extend these
unions to the provinces, and even to the Confederation of
the Rhine, in order to strengthen the connection of
those distant portions of the empire with France; but
in such proceedings, I exerted only my influence, and
never my authority. Lord Castlereagh disregards such
distinctions; it is important to his policy to render me
odious; he is not scrupulous about the means; he does
not shrink from any calumny; he has every advantage
over me. I am in chains; he has taken all possible precautions
for keeping my mouth shut, and preventing the
possibility of my making any reply, and I am a thousand
leagues from the scene of action; his position is
commanding; nothing stands in his way. But certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>this conduct is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ne plus ultra</em></span> of impudence,
baseness, and cowardice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now introduce an instance which may serve to
prove the truth of the foregoing assertion of Napoleon
with respect to French heiresses. I had the account
from the lips of the person chiefly interested.</p>

<p class='c001'>M. d’Aligre had a daughter who was heiress to immense
property: the Emperor conceived the idea of
marrying her to M. de Caulaincourt, Duke of Vicenza,
for whom he had such a particular regard that he was
looked upon as a kind of favourite. His personal qualities,
not less than his high official employment, rendered
him one of the first personages in the empire. The
Emperor, therefore, never imagined that there could be
the slightest impediment to this union. He sent for
M. d’Aligre, who often came to Court, and made his
request; but M. d’Aligre had other views, and declined
the alliance. Napoleon urged it in every possible way,
but M. d’Aligre remained immoveable. From his manner
of relating the affair to me, it was evident that he
thought he had shewn great courage, and, in fact, he
deserved the credit of having done so, for he imagined,
like all of us, that it was very dangerous to thwart the
Emperor’s inclinations. We were, however, all mistaken;
we did not know Napoleon. I am now convinced
that the justice due to individuals, and to family
rights in particular, are sacred to him; and I never
heard that M. d’Aligre suffered any inconvenience whatever
through his refusal.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor tried some of Pigault Le
Brun’s romances and others of the same kind, but in
vain: after turning over a few pages of each, he rejected
them all, saying that they were all in very bad
taste.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE GOVERNOR’S STATEMENTS RESPECTING THE<br /> EXPENSES AT LONGWOOD, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Friday, 28th.—Towards one o’clock, the Emperor
sent for me and my son. We carried him the first
chapter of the Campaigns of Italy, with our last work
completing it. He detained us until almost six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>The Governor had paid a visit to the Grand Marshal,
and in a vague manner given him reason to expect some
reductions at Longwood. He had stated, with some
simplicity, that it had been expected at London that
the permission which had been offered us to return to
Europe would have greatly diminished the Emperor’s
domestic circle. He had also said, without being well
understood by the Grand Marshal, that, if we had any
private property, we might avail ourselves of our own
money, by drawing upon our own funds, as I had already
done. His government, he said, had never intended
to allow the Emperor more than a table for four
persons daily at most, and company to dine once a-week.
What a statement! Is it possible that he meant to insinuate
that, with respect to us, we ought to pay for our
maintenance, and contribute, for the future, to the expenses
of the establishment? Let it not be thought
incredible: we daily learn here to believe that there is
nothing impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, afterwards, reverting to a book which
he had been reading, and in which there was a story of an
Irish lady, respecting whom Goldsmith had abused him
violently, recollected well, he said, that, being at Bayonne
at the chateau de Marrach, when the city of Bourdeaux
gave him a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fête</em></span>, he saw, by the side of the Empress
Josephine, a charming face of the most perfect beauty,
with which he was forcibly struck. The impression she
had made did not pass unperceived. It had been anticipated
and brought about designedly. “God knows,”
said the Emperor, “with what intention. She was a
Miss ——, afterwards Madame ——, a new reader to
the Empress Josephine, whom she attended to the chateau
de Marrach, and might very possibly have had
great success. She already occupied my thoughts, when
M. de Lavalette, who was at the head of the secret
department of the post-office, destroyed the charm. He
sent, direct to me, a letter addressed to this young lady.
It was from her mother, or her aunt, an Irishwoman,
and contained minute directions for the part she was to
play, and particularly urged her by all means to contrive
to secure such a living pledge as might prolong her empire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>or at least secure her great influence. On reading
this,” said the Emperor, “all illusion vanished. The
coarseness of the intrigue, the turpitude of the details,
the style, the hand which had written the letter; but,
above all, her being a foreigner, produced immediate
disgust; and the pretty little Irish girl was, in fact, as
Goldsmith says, put into a post-chaise and suddenly
packed off to Paris. And here I find,” continued Napoleon,
“a libel imputing this to me as a crime, when, in
fact, it was much rather a virtue in me; an act of continence,
of which I might, perhaps, boast with much
more reason than the famous Scipio. But this is the
way in which history is written.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, when we were debating what we should
read, the Emperor said that, since we confessed we had
not wit enough to relate each his tale or story, we ought
at least to be condemned to choose, by turns, our evening’s
reading; and he began by naming for his part,
the poem <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>De la Pitié</cite></span>, by the Abbé Delille. He thought
the verses good, the language pure, the ideas pleasing;
nevertheless, he observed, it was destitute of imagination
or warmth. It was, undoubtedly, superior in versification
to Voltaire; but still far beneath our other great masters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Saturday, 29th.—The Emperor breakfasted in the
garden, and invited us all. After breakfast he took
an airing in the calash. He was in good spirits, and
rallied us all in our turns. One he complimented on
the beauty and elegance of his apartments, another on
the sums which the Governor had paid for him, and
which would soon be increased by a handsome stock of
child-bed linen; me he congratulated on the taste which
the Governor seemed to have for my bills of exchange,
which had induced his Excellency to wish the rest to
draw bills likewise. He laughed, and was highly amused
with our remarks on each other. The weather suddenly
changed and obliged him to return home.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor read some passages of Milton,
translated by the Abbé Delille. He thought the
versification very inferior to the poem <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>De la Pitié</cite></span>; and,
in fact, it was a work prescribed to the author, written
during his emigration, whilst at London, and published
by subscription.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>During the whole of our morning’s ride, the conversation
turned on our kings and their mistresses: Mesdames
de Montespan, de Pompadour, Dubarry, &amp;c. The
principle was warmly discussed, opinions differed, and
were obstinately defended. The Emperor amused himself
with fluctuating alternately from one opinion to another.
He concluded, however, by deciding in favour of
morality.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE COURT OF LONDON DURING OUR EMIGRATION.—GEORGE III.—MR. PITT.—THE PRINCE OF WALES.—ANECDOTES.—THE NASSAUS.—REMARKABLE DIGRESSION OF NAPOLEON TO HIS OWN HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Sunday, 30th.—The Emperor desired me to be called
early in the morning to breakfast with him; he
was sad, gloomy, and unable to converse; he could not
find words. Chance having produced the mention of
London and of my emigration, the Emperor said, by
way of fixing on a subject, and finding something to occupy
his attention, “You must have seen in London,
the Court, the King, the Prince of Wales, Mr. Pitt,
Mr. Fox, and other great personages who figured at that
time? Tell me what you know of them. What did people
think of them? Give me an historical sketch.”—"Sire,
your Majesty forgets, or perhaps was never precisely
informed of the situation of an emigrant in London.
I doubt whether we should have been received at
Court; the good old George III. was deeply concerned
for our personal misfortunes, but he was extremely reluctant
to avow us in a political sense. And if we could
have been received there, our means would not have
enabled us to appear. I did not therefore go to Court.
I have, however, seen most of those whom your Majesty
mentions, and I have also heard much said of
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I have seen and heard the King several times in the
House of Lords, and been very near him; the Prince of
Wales in the same place, and also in company in the
metropolis. Besides, it is not in London as in France;
we do not find there that immense distance between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the Court and the mass of the nation; the country
is so crowded, information so general, education so
equal, affluence so common, and the sphere of activity
so rapid, that the whole nation seems to be in the same
place and on the same plane; whilst, in looking at this
assemblage, which might deserve to be called distinguished,
one is tempted to ask, <em>Where is the people?</em>
which is, in fact, the question that Alexander is said to
have asked at the time of his visit to London. It follows
then, that having seen many people of all classes, conditions,
and opinions, I must have imbibed some notions
approaching in all probability very near the truth. Unluckily,
I was then little solicitous about observing and
collecting information; and I am likewise fearful that
the lapse of so much time may now confuse my memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>"George the Third was the honestest man in his
dominions; his personal virtues made him an object of
profound veneration; an extreme morality, and great
respect for the laws, were the principal characteristics
of his whole life. He came to the throne at
twenty years of age, deeply enamoured of a charming
young Scotch lady, of one of the first families in
the country, it was much feared that he would marry
her; but it was sufficient to remind him that it was
contrary to law, and he instantly consented to marry
the person who should be chosen for him. This was a
princess of Mecklenburg. In his grief, he thought her
very ordinary, and in fact she was so; nevertheless
George III. remained all his life an exemplary husband;
he was never known to be guilty of the least infidelity.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The accession of George III. was an actual political
revolution in England: the days of the Pretenders were
over; the house of Hanover was established; the Whigs,
who had placed that family on the throne, were dismissed
from administration: they were troublesome observers,
who were no longer wanted. The government was
again seized by the Tories, those friends of power, who
have ever since kept it, to the great detriment of public
liberty.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The King, however, was personally free from prejudice
in this respect: he sincerely loved the laws, justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>and the welfare and prosperity of his country. The
violent part taken by England against our French revolution
was much less the fault of George III. than of
Mr. Pitt, who was the real firebrand. The latter was
instigated by the extreme hatred to France which he inherited
from his father, the great Chatham, and also by
a strong predilection for power and the oligarchy. At
the commencement of our revolution, Mr. Pitt was the
man of the people: he governed England; he drew in
the King, who was always to be worked on by facts;
and it must be acknowledged that the excesses and
crimes of our outset afforded very favourable opportunities
to the measures and the eloquence of Mr. Pitt. It
is probable, Sire, that if the unfortunate George III. had
retained his reason, your Majesty would eventually have
found it greatly to your advantage, because your reign
would have presented new facts to his observation, to
which he would have yielded. George III. had his own
species and degree of character: it was in harmony with
his intellectual conceptions: he wished to know things,
to be convinced. When once his resolution was taken,
it was difficult to make him alter it; yet it was not
impossible: his good sense afforded great opportunities.</p>

<p class='c001'>"His illness was, on this account, a curse to us, a
curse to Europe, and to the English themselves, who
begin now to give up the high opinion they once professed
of Mr. Pitt, of whose fatal errors they now feel
the effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>"It was the first attack of the King’s illness which
established the reputation and credit of Mr. Pitt. That
minister was little more than twenty-five years of age,
when he ventured alone to encounter the mass of those
who deserted the King and considered him lost; and
who were eager to proclaim the monarch’s incapacity, in
order to possess themselves of power under his youthful
successor. This conduct rendered Mr. Pitt the idol of
the nation. This was the most glorious period of his
life; and his noblest triumph was, undoubtedly, that of
conducting George III. to St. Paul’s, to return thanks
to God for his restoration to health, amidst an immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>concourse of people intoxicated with joy and satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>"There was no doubt that Mr. Pitt was on this occasion
the saviour of the King as well as of the public peace;
for experience proved that George III. had not become
incapable of reigning again; and it was strongly suspected
that, had the regency been organized, as the Opposition
wished to have it, this capability would not have
been very readily acknowledged at a subsequent period;
and thus a civil war might have been occasioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I have often heard it said that the mental derangement
of George III. was not a common kind of madness:
that his alienation did not exactly arise from a local affection
of the brain, but from the repletion of the vessels
leading to it; a derangement produced by a malady which
had long been peculiar to this family. His disorder, it was
said, was rather delirium than insanity. When the cause
was removed, the sovereign instantly recovered all his
faculties, in as great perfection as if they had sustained
no interruption; this circumstance explains his numerous
relapses and restorations. As a proof of this, people used
to mention the strength of mind he must have possessed,
to be able, immediately on his first convalescence, to
support the pomp of the procession, attended by the
assembled population of London, filling the air with
acclamations.</p>

<p class='c001'>"After his second relapse, he gave another not less remarkable
proof of this nature, by the calmness and composure
which he displayed, when fired at by an assassin,
as he entered his box at the theatre. He was so little
disturbed that he instantly turned to the Queen, who
had just reached the door of the box, to tell her not to
be alarmed, for that it was only a squib which had been
let off in the theatre: he remained during the whole performance
apparently unmoved. Here was certainly no
proof of weakness. The permanence of the complaint
in his latter years might indeed be opposed to these facts,
if it be certain that he had not long lucid intervals.</p>

<p class='c001'>"George III., although so worthy and well-meaning
a monarch, was several times very near falling a victim
to assassins. Several instances of this kind occur in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>history; and I do not believe any of the persons implicated
suffered death, because they all appeared to be
insane—all religious or political fanatics. The last and
most famous attempt occurred, I think, in 1800.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The
King went to the theatre, as he did from time to time at
that critical period, to keep up his popularity. As he
entered his box, a man in the pit took aim at him with a
horse pistol, and the ball only missed through the King’s
bowing at the moment to salute the public. The dreadful
tumult that ensued may easily be conceived! The man
did not attempt to deny his crime; he was precisely such
another as the fanatic at Schoenbrun, who would have
sacrificed your Majesty, and always maintained that he
had no other object in view than peace and the happiness
of his country. A jury pronounced this man insane,
and he was condemned to confinement.</p>

<p class='c001'>"During my excursion to London in 1814, a singular
chance procured me a sight of this very assassin. My
mind being still occupied with the mission which your
Majesty had confided to me the preceding year, concerning
the depôts of mendicity and houses of correction, I
wished to see the English establishments of this kind.
Whilst I was taking a minute survey of Newgate, I entered
an apartment in which I found a great number of
condemned persons enjoying a certain degree of liberty.
The first on whom my conductor fixed his eyes happened
to be Hatfield, whom he pointed out to me, and whose
name I immediately recollected, and asked if he was the
man who had attempted to assassinate George III. It
was the same, he said, and he was undergoing the confinement
to which he had been condemned, as insane, in
Newgate. I observed that, at the time, his insanity had
been much doubted and contested by the public, as it
always happens in such cases. I was assured, however,
that Hatfield was indisputably mad, but only by fits; that
his madness was, however, so mild that he was suffered
to go about the town, on his word; and that he was the
first to request he might be attended to, when he felt that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>his disorder was coming on. My conductor then called
him. Having ventured to ask him some questions, he
immediately discovered me to be French by my accent,
and told me he had often fought against my countrymen
in Flanders. (He had served in the light-horse, or
dragoons, under the Duke of York.) He bore their
marks, he said, shewing me several scars; and yet, he
added, he was far from hating them, for they were
brave, and were not to blame in that affair; people had
insisted on meddling in their disputes, which concerned
themselves only. He began to grow very warm, which
induced my conductor to make me a sign, and to send
him away. We had touched the chord of his derangement,
my conductor observed, and had we continued, he
would have become outrageous.</p>

<p class='c001'>"But I return to George III. The predominant
sentiment of that prince was the love of the public good
and the welfare of his country. To these he always
sacrificed every consideration: this alone induced him to
retain Mr. Pitt so long, towards whom he felt a strong
repugnance, because he was very ill-treated by that
minister.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The crisis was of the most vital importance to England;
the danger most imminent; the talents of the
Prime Minister of a superior kind. He was, therefore,
necessary. Presuming on the omnipotence of this circumstance
over the King’s mind, Mr. Pitt ruled him
tyrannically, and without the least delicacy; he scarcely
allowed him the disposal of the most trifling place. If
there was a vacancy, and the King wished to reward a
private servant of his own, he was always too late; Mr.
Pitt had already disposed of it, and for the good of the
state, he would say—for the sake of parliamentary
services. If the King shewed too much dissatisfaction,
Mr. Pitt had one invariable answer constantly ready—he
would resign and give up his place to another. At
length a circumstance occurred of the most delicate kind,
as it concerned the King’s conscience, who was very
religious; that is to say, the question of the emancipation
of the Catholics of Ireland, to which he obstinately
refused to consent. Mr. Pitt insisted with equal perseverance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>he was pledged to this measure, he said, and
resorted to his usual threat. But the King this time
took him at his word, and, overjoyed at his deliverance,
repeated the same day, to several persons, that he had
now got rid of a man who had for twenty years been
kicking at him. And it may not, perhaps, be useless to
observe here, as a remarkable singularity, in contrast to
Mr. Pitt’s ill usage of the King, that George III. has
been heard to say that, of all his ministers, Mr. Fox (so
much accused of republicanism, and perhaps not without
foundation) was the person who, when at the head of
affairs, had constantly shewn him the greatest delicacy,
deference, respect, and attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Nevertheless, such was the influence of the public
interest over the King’s mind that, notwithstanding all
his aversion, he reinstated Mr. Pitt a year afterwards.
It was thought, at the time, that when Mr. Pitt retired
he had had the address to fix Mr. Addington, a creature
of his own, in the ministry, in order to be able to replace
himself there in a short time without difficulty: but it
has since been proved that Mr. Pitt himself was obliged
to have recourse to intrigues to overthrow his successor
and obtain his second administration, which, however,
was by no means worthy of him: it was filled with
disasters which he himself had occasioned. The ball
that decided the victory of Austerlitz killed him in
London.</p>

<p class='c001'>"Time daily undermines the great reputation of Mr.
Pitt, not with respect to his eminent talents, but their
fatal employment. England groans under the calamities
with which he overwhelmed her, the most fatal of which
are the school and the doctrines he bequeathed to her.
He introduced the police into England, accustomed the
nation to an armed force, and commenced that system
of informations, snares, and demoralization of every
kind so completely perfected by his successors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His great system of tactics was constantly to excite
our excesses on the Continent, and then to hold them up
as a scarecrow to England, which immediately granted
him all he wanted.” “But what did you all say to that?”
asked the Emperor: “What was the opinion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>emigrants?”—"Sire," I replied, “we all constantly
saw through the same glass; what we said the first day
of our emigration we still repeated on the last day of
our exile. We had not advanced one step; we had
become and remained a people by ourselves. Mr. Pitt
was our oracle; whatever was said by him, by Burke,
Windham, or any of the most violent on that side of
the question, appeared to us to be delicious; all that
their adversaries objected, abominable. Fox, Sheridan,
and Grey, were in our eyes nothing but infamous
Jacobins; we never called them by any other name.”
“Very well,” said the Emperor; “now return to
George III.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"This virtuous prince was excessively partial to
private life and rural occupations; he devoted all the
time he could spare from the business of the state to the
cultivation of a farm a few miles from London; he never
returned to the capital except for his regular levées, or
extraordinary councils required by circumstances; and
he immediately returned to his fields, where he lived
without pomp, and like an honest farmer, as he said
himself. All intrigues were left in town, about the
ministers, and amongst them.</p>

<p class='c001'>"George III. had many domestic troubles. His sister
was Matilda Queen of Denmark, whose story forms so
melancholy a romance; his two brothers caused him
many vexations by their marriages; and he had not
reason to be perfectly satisfied with his eldest son.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The two brothers of George III. were the Duke of
Cumberland and the Duke of Gloucester. I often saw
the latter in private society; he was the worthiest, most
polite, and honourable gentleman in England. Both
these illustrious individuals, according to the spirit of
the British constitution, were entirely strangers to public
business. The King heard that one of them had married
or was about to marry a private individual. This was a
great crime in his estimation; he had himself made a
great sacrifice to avoid committing it. He was extremely
angry; and whilst he was sending a message to Parliament
against the brother who had thus given offence, he
was informed that the other had eloped to Calais for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>similar purpose. It was like a fatality, an absolute
epidemic, for it was at the same time reported on all
sides, that the heir-apparent himself was also secretly
married.”—"What," said the Emperor, “the Prince of
Wales!”—"Yes, Sire, himself: his marriage was every
where talked of, but with circumstances not sufficiently
certain for me to venture to repeat them; the fact, however,
seemed generally acknowledged. But, as the Prince
afterwards caused it to be contradicted in Parliament,
through the medium of the opposition, we are bound
after that to believe him.</p>

<p class='c001'>"I have it, however, from the mouth of a very near
relation of his pretended wife, that the matter was positively
so. I heard this person give way to the most
violent rage on the solemn marriage of the prince, and
threaten to resort to personal violence. It might, therefore,
be considered a contested point, which was
unavoidably represented according to party-spirit;
some obstinately maintaining the reality of the marriage,
whilst others denied it in the most violent manner.
Perhaps this contradiction might be reconciled by the
consideration that the person he was said to have married,
Mrs. Fitzherbert, was a Catholic. This circumstance
rendered the marriage impossible in the eyes of
the law, and perfectly void with respect to the heir to
the throne. However this may be, I have often met
Mrs. Fitzherbert in company: her carriage bore the
Prince’s arms, and her servants wore his livery. This
lady was much older than himself; but beautiful, agreeable,
of a powerful mind, and haughty, impatient temper,
which often involved her in disputes with the Prince,
and gave rise, it was said, to scenes of violence not very
becoming such elevated rank. It was during one of the
last quarrels of this kind, when, they say, Mrs. Fitzherbert
had obstinately kept the door shut against the
Prince, that Mr. Pitt dexterously took the opportunity of
persuading him to consent to a marriage with the Princess
of Brunswick."—"But stay," said the Emperor,
“you go too fast; you pass over what chiefly interests
me. Under what auspices did the Prince of Wales enter
into life? What was there peculiar in his political conduct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>his situation with regard to the Opposition, and so
forth?”—"This Prince, Sire, came before the public
with all the advantages of face, person, and mind. He
was greeted with universal enthusiasm; but he soon
evinced those inclinations, and began to act that part,
which seemed necessarily imposed on great personages
in the middle of the last century. Such were the infatuation
of gaming, and its consequent embarrassments;
table and other excesses; and, above all, a set of companions
disapproved of by the public. Then it was that
all generous hearts were grieved; hope was blighted,
and the middling class, which in every country really constitutes
the nation, and which, it must be confessed, is
in England the most moral population of all Europe,
despaired of the future. It was a received adage in
England, amongst the lower classes in particular, that
the Prince of Wales would never reign; the fortune-tellers
and conjurors, it was said, had foretold it to
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The opposition, into whose arms he had thrown
himself, as heirs presumptive too frequently do; the
opposition, whose stay and hope he was, perhaps trying
to deceive themselves, when this misconduct was mentioned
to them, used to get over it by saying that he
would be another Henry V.; that Henry V. had been
extremely dissipated when Prince of Wales; but that he
became the greatest King the monarchy had produced;
and thence they concluded that the Prince of Wales
would make one of their greatest kings.”—"But did he
adopt the revolutionary party and defend our modern
ideas?" said the Emperor. "No, Sire; as the fever of
revolutionary principles increased, decency compelled
him to withdraw by degrees from the opposition which
defended them. He relinquished all ostensible alliance,
and filled up the void of his life by giving himself up to
pleasure and its attendant difficulties. He was constantly
overwhelmed with debts, although parliament had already
paid them several times. By these encumbrances he was
greatly embarrassed, and his character and popularity
were endangered. It was whilst thus involved, and
during a quarrel with Mrs. Fitzherbert, that Mr. Pitt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>got hold of him, offering to pay his debts again, if he
would adopt his father’s views and consent to marry.
He was obliged to submit to all that was prescribed, and
the hand of the Princess of Brunswick was asked and
obtained. But, during the short interval of the negotiation,
a celebrated woman who had long aspired to
govern the prince, finding the place vacant, took possession
of it herself. It is pretended that she has said
she had sought this connection for twenty years; for she
was much older than himself, a circumstance which
seemed to indicate a peculiar taste in this family, having
also been remarked in several of his brothers. This
person was immediately appointed Lady of the Bed-chamber
to the future Princess of Wales; she even went
to meet her and bring her to England. It was under
such auspices, such malignant influence, that the bride
landed on the British shore. Accordingly, it is positively
asserted that this unhappy princess had not even so
much as twenty-four hours’ enjoyment, out of that
privileged period emphatically called by the English
the honey-moon. From the very day after her marriage,
ridicule, neglect, and contempt were her portion.</p>

<p class='c001'>"All who possessed the least spark of generosity or
morality in England took her part, and loudly exclaimed
against the manner in which she was treated. The
greater share of the odium, however, fell on Lady Jersey,
who was accused of having bewitched the prince. She
became the object of public execration; yet the Prince,
it was declared could not plead the excuse of illusion or
blindness; for it is said that, after a very gay entertainment
amongst his jovial companions, one of them
was led, in the course of conversation, to say that he
knew the Madame de Merteuil of the Liaisons Dangereuses.
Many of the others immediately cried out
that they also knew one: upon this, it is said, the Prince
proposed, for a frolic, that each should write his secret
separately. All the notes were thrown into a vase; and
the name of Lady Jersey was found written on every one
of them: the Prince himself, not having looked for such
unanimity, or expected to be discovered, had written
this name as well as the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>"I knew this Lady Jersey, and it must be confessed
that her face and whole appearance were so little indicative
of her age, that it could not easily have been suspected.
She had all the charms of early youth, heightened
by all the grace of the most elegant manners; and I am
bound to say, that, in the circles in which I saw her, she
even possessed a sort of attractive kindness; whether
the manners of her class render the disposition indulgent,
or whether she did not in fact deserve all the reproaches
with which she was loaded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Prince of Wales seems to have possessed a
peculiar faculty, a gift, which the English call the power
of fascination. He is endowed with it in the highest
degree; one would think that his will was sufficient to
reclaim the attachment of the multitude, and as it were
to corrupt public opinion. His history is full of those
losses and returns of popularity; and, perhaps, it is the
certainty of being able to command this sort of success
that has so often led him, as his detractors say, to disregard
public opinion. His enemies have asserted that he
has carried this species of courage to absolute heroism.
They have censured him for his hardihood in persisting,
whilst lying himself under the reproach of an irregular
life, in accusing his wife of that conduct of which he set
the example; an inconsistency which ought, undoubtedly,
to be attributed to the fatal suggestions of pernicious
counsellors, inimical to his glory and tranquillity. It is
at least certain, that the basest corruption, the aid of the
laws, and the influence of the heir to the throne, were all
employed against the Princess, and all in vain: a circumstance
which, it is said, used to torment the Prince and
expose him to ridicule. People laughed at his unprecedented
ill-luck, in being unable to prove, with all his
endeavours, what so many husbands would give so much
to conceal. Hatred increased on every new defeat, and
with it the sufferings of the victim. She was reduced,
at last, to a sort of banishment, to a place a few miles
from London; she was deprived of her daughter; she
was insulted in the sight of the allied Sovereigns when
they visited London. But the expression of the feelings
of the multitude was always ready to avenge her, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>became necessary to get her to quit England; which she
was induced to do voluntarily, by the aid, perhaps, of
the perfidious insinuations of some pretended friend.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Emperor again interrupted me, saying that
I was leaving out a very essential point. “When and
how had the Prince attained the Royal authority? How
had he arranged matters with the opposition? What had
he done with those old friends?” “Sire,” I replied, "my
information ends here. There was a time when political
events induced your Majesty to cut off all intercourse
between England and France. We no longer obtained
the papers; we were prevented from receiving letters;
the two nations had no longer any thing in common.
There is, therefore, an actual blank in my intelligence,
which I should be unwilling to fill up with mere conjectures.
I understand, however, that after several recoveries
and relapses of the old King, all parties at length
agreed to consign the regency to the Prince of Wales,
and place him in full possession of the sovereign authority.
The long expected period of changes and of hopes
was at length arrived. The gates of heaven were now
to open, at length, to that opposition which had so long
eulogised the Prince; to those old friends who had
seemed from infancy to unite their fate with his. But,
to the great and universal surprise of the nation, and
through I know not what contrivance of Lord Castlereagh’s,
nothing was altered. Those old ministers, who
had so long been the objects of the Prince’s dislike and
censure, kept their places, and those intimate and dearly
beloved friends, who had so long been caressed, remained
out of office.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The opposition complained loudly; but they were
laughed at, and told that when the wild Prince of Wales
became a great King, his first care was to get rid of his
old companions. The jest might be a very good one,
but it was by no means applicable; for the greatest characters
in the empire were at the head of this opposition;
and they were far from being Falstaffs or profligates of
that kind. From that instant they evinced a marked
coolness towards the Prince: some would no longer see
him; others refused his invitations, or repelled the advances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>which he made to them. It is said, however,
that one of them suffered himself to be persuaded to go
to dine in private with the Prince. The latter, recurring
to his usual victorious weapons, endeavoured to prove to
him, with his accustomed grace, that he could not have
acted differently; and at length desired to be told of
what his old friends could justly accuse him. The guest,
whose heart was still swelling with indignation, seized
the opportunity, and freely told him all his faults, with
such warmth, that the Princess Charlotte, who was at
table, and was perhaps secretly inclined towards the
guest’s opinion, burst into tears. Lord Byron heard of
this scene the next day, and consecrated the event in
these celebrated verses:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1814, at the time of my visit to London, I had
the honour of being presented to the Prince of Wales at
Carlton House.”—“And what the devil did you want
there?” said the Emperor. “I do not wonder that your
Majesty is surprised; but I was induced by a sort of
point of honour: I thought I could do no other. There
were many French in London at that time; I was the
only one who had been near your Majesty’s person, worn
your colours, and followed the line of conduct which
seemed to be censured at that period. Some one having
told me that the others would certainly not endure my
presence, that circumstance determined me to go. We
were, in fact, twenty-two Frenchmen, presented at the
same time, at one of the Prince’s grand levees; and I
must say that I never saw more graceful manners, more
pleasing expression, more harmony in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tout-ensemble</em></span>;
I thought him the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>beau-ideal</em></span> of elegance. I comprehended
the full power, the whole truth of that magic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>fascination which I had so often heard attributed to him;
and even at this moment, Sire, when I recollect that fine
countenance, on which I thought I perceived elevation
of mind, and the love and desire of glory, I cannot help
asking myself how your Majesty comes to be here, how
those atrocious ministers could induce him to declare
himself the gaoler, the...?” “My dear Sir,”
said the Emperor, “perhaps you were no physiognomist;
you took the halo of coquetry for that of greatness;
the study to please for the love of glory; and, besides,
the love of glory is not exactly in the face; it is
in the recesses of the heart, and you did not search
there.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“But were you not translating to me, the other day,”
said the Emperor, "some journal or work, in which it
was stated that the Prince Regent had made a great
display of sympathy towards the last Stuarts; that he
had paid the most extravagant prices for things which
had belonged to, and been left by them; that he had
talked of raising a monument to the last of them?
There is much more calculation than magnanimity in
all that; it is because he is anxious to establish and
consecrate their extinction. From that event his legitimacy
and security date; and he is in the right. If, in
my time, and under the circumstances into which the
English Ministers had plunged the nation, there had
been some young Stuart, of a brave and enterprising
character, equal to the present age, he would have been
landed in Ireland, escorted by the modern doctrines;
and then we should undoubtedly have seen the regenerate
Stuarts driving out the degenerate Brunswicks.
England would have had its 20th of March. Such are
thrones and their contagious influence; scarcely is one
seated there when the poison begins to operate. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Brunswicks, brought in by liberal ideas, raised by the
will of the people, have no sooner ascended the throne,
than they grasp at arbitrary and despotic power; they
must absolutely drive their wheels in the track which
overturned their predecessors; and this because they are
become Kings! And it should seem that this is the inevitable
course! That fine stem of the Nassaus, for instance,
those patrons of noble independence in Europe,
whose liberalism ought to be in the blood, and even in
the marrow of their bones; those Nassaus, who, as far
as regards their dominions, would be only at the tail,
and who might by their doctrines, place themselves at
the head,—they have just been placed on a throne;
well, you will infallibly see them concern themselves
about nothing but becoming what they call legitimates;
and adopt the principles, the proceedings, and the errors
of that class.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, after all, my dear Sir, has not the same thing
been said of me, myself? and perhaps not without some
appearance of reason; for probably many circumstances
may have escaped my observation. Nevertheless I declared,
on a solemn occasion, that in my estimation the
sovereign power was not in the title, nor the throne in
its splendour. It has been said of me, that scarcely
had I attained power, when I exercised a despotic and
arbitrary sway; but it was rather a Dictatorship; and
the circumstances of the times will be a sufficient excuse
for me. I have also been reproached with having suffered
myself to be intoxicated with pride at my alliance
with the house of Austria, and having thought myself
more truly a sovereign after my marriage; in fact, of
having considered myself from that time as Alexander,
become the son of a god! But can all this be just? Did
I really fall into such errors? A young, handsome,
agreeable, woman fell to my lot; was it inadmissible for
me to testify some satisfaction? Could I not devote a
few moments to her without incurring blame? Was I
not to be allowed to abandon myself to a few hours of
happiness? Was I required to use my wife ill from the
very first night, like your Prince ——? Or was I,
like the Sultan we have read of, to have her head struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>off, in order to escape the reproaches of the multitude?
No! my only fault in that alliance was that of carrying
too plebeian a heart with me. How often have I said
that the heart of a statesman ought only to be in his
head. Mine, unfortunately, in this instance, remained
in its place, subject to family feelings, and this marriage
ruined me; because I believed, above all things, in the
religion, the piety, the morality, and the honour of
Francis I. He has cruelly deceived me. I am willing
to believe that he was himself deceived; and I forgive
him with all my heart. But will history spare him? If,
however,...”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here Napoleon was silent for a few moments, resting
his head on one of his hands; then resuming, “But
what a romance is my life!” said he, rising. “Open
the door, and let us walk.” And we walked up and
down the adjoining rooms, for some time.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MY SON’S FALL FROM HIS HORSE.—PILLAGE IN WAR.—CHARACTER OF THE FRENCH SOLDIER.—PARTICULARS RELATING TO WATERLOO, BY THE NEW ADMIRAL.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Monday July 1st to Thursday 4th.—Yesterday, my son’s
horse ran away with him, whilst he was taking a ride;
and, being fearful that the horse might dash him against
the trees, he thought it best to throw himself off his
back. He had sprained his ancle sufficiently to condemn
him to the sofa for a month.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor condescended to come into my room,
about 11 o’clock, to learn the state of my son, whom he
rated well for his awkwardness. I followed him into
the garden, where he breakfasted, which he had not
done there for some time previously.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversation turned on pillage by armies, and the
horrors occasioned by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pavia, the Emperor said, was the only place that he
had ever given up to pillage; he had promised it to his
soldiers for 24 hours; “but after three hours,” said he,
“I could bear it no longer, and I put an end to it. I
had but 1200 men;” said he, “the cries of the populace
which reached my ears prevailed. If there had been
20,000 soldiers, their numbers would have drowned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>complaints of the people, and I should have heard nothing
of it. Happily, however, policy and morality are
equally opposed to the system of pillage. I have meditated
much on this subject: and have often been urged
to gratify my soldiers in this manner. But nothing is so
certain to disorganize and completely ruin an army. A
soldier loses all discipline as soon as he gets an opportunity
to pillage; and, if by pillage he enriches himself, he
immediately becomes a bad soldier, and will not fight.
Besides,” continued he, “pillage is incompatible with
our French manners; the hearts of our soldiers are not
bad; when the first transport of fury is over, they come
to themselves again. It would be impossible for French
soldiers to pillage for twenty-four hours; many of them
would employ the latter part of the time in repairing the
mischief they had done in the beginning. They afterwards
reproach each other, in their quarters, with the
excesses they have committed, and load with reprobation
and contempt those whose conduct has been particularly
odious.”</p>

<p class='c001'>About three o’clock, the new Admiral, Sir Pulteney
Malcolm, and all his officers, were presented to the Emperor.
The Admiral first conversed with the Emperor
alone, for nearly two hours. He must have been much
impressed with this conversation, for he said, as he came
out, that he had been taking a very fine and valuable
lesson on the history of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor was understood to have said to him,
towards the close of the interview, what I believe I have
already introduced elsewhere on this subject. “You
have levied a contribution of 700 millions on France;
I have imposed one of more than 10,000 millions on
your country. You raised yours by your bayonets: I
caused mine to be raised by your parliament.” “And
that is the true summary of the matter,” replied the
Admiral.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Admiral was bringing from America some old
troops consisting of 12,000 men, without the least suspicion
of the new state of Europe. At sea, a vessel
informed him of the return of the Emperor from the isle
of Elba, and the consequent revolution; it seemed to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>so magical that he could scarcely believe it. But when
he arrived in sight of Plymouth, he received orders to
proceed, with all possible expedition, to Ostend; he
reached it in time, and 4000 of the men on board his
ships were enabled to take part in the battle, and they
were unquestionably amongst the best troops in the
whole line, as the Admiral declared. Who can determine
what degree of influence they may have had? The
English thought the battle lost, during the whole day,
and they acknowledge that it would have been so, but for
Grouchy’s error.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ANECDOTES ON THE 18TH BRUMAIRE.—SIEYES.—GRAND</h3>
<p class='c007'>ELECTOR.—CAMBACERES.—LEBRUN, &amp;C.</p>

<p class='c001'>After walking some time in the garden, the Emperor
got into his calash. The weather was delightful: we
made two turns at full gallop. I was alone with him.
He spoke much of my son, and his future prospects, with
a degree of interest and kindness which went to my
heart. He said that, considering his age, the circumstance
of being sent to St. Helena was of inestimable
value to his future life; that it must be like a hot-house
for bringing forward his character.</p>

<p class='c001'>After dinner, the Emperor resumed the subject of the
18th Brumaire, and related it to us with an infinite
number of minor details. As he has long since dictated
it to General Gourgaud, I shall refer to his publication
for the mass of the particulars of that event. I shall only
give here some little anecdotes or accessories which
possibly may not be found there.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon’s situation on his return from Egypt was
unprecedented. He had found himself immediately
applied to by all parties, and had been entrusted with
all their secrets. There were three which were particularly
distinct; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Manege</em></span>, of which General J. was one
of the leaders; the <em>Moderates</em>, directed by Sieyes; and
the <em>Rotten</em> party, with Barras at their head.</p>

<p class='c001'>The determination which Napoleon formed to ally
himself with the Moderates, exposed him, he said, to
great danger. With the Jacobins he would have risked
nothing; they offered to name him Dictator. “But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>after conquering with them,” observed the Emperor, “it
would have been necessary, almost immediately, to conquer
against them. A club cannot endure a permanent
chief; it wants one for every successive passion. Now
to make use of a party one day, in order to attack it the
next, under whatever pretext it is done, is still a piece of
treachery; it was inconsistent with my principles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir,” said the Emperor to me, at another
moment, after having again run over the events of the 18th
of Brumaire, "that is a far different thing, you will allow,
from the conspiracy of St. Real, in which there is much
more plotting, and much less result; ours was struck at
a single blow. It is certain that there never was a great
revolution which caused less inconvenience; it was so
generally desired; it was accordingly crowned with universal
applause.</p>

<p class='c001'>"For my own part, all my share in the plot, for effecting
this change, was confined to the assembling the
whole crowd of my visitors at the same hour in the
morning, and marching at their head to seize on power.
It was from the threshold of my door, from the top of
my own steps, and without my friends having any previous
knowledge of my intentions, that I led them to this
conquest; it was amidst the brilliant escort they formed,
their lively joy, and unanimous ardour, that I presented
myself at the bar of the ancients, to thank them for the
Dictatorship with which they invested me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Metaphysicians have disputed, and will long dispute,
whether we did not violate the laws, and whether
we were not criminal; but these are mere abstractions,
at best fit for books and tribunes, and which ought to
disappear before imperative necessity: one might as well
blame a sailor for waste and destruction, when he cuts
away his masts to avoid being upset. The fact is that,
had it not been for us the country must have been lost:
and we saved it. The authors and chief agents of that
memorable state transaction may and ought, instead of
attempting denials or justifications, to answer their accusers
proudly, like the Roman, <em>We protest that we have
saved our country; come with us and return thanks to
the gods</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>On the completion of the Revolution of the 18th Brumaire,
three provisional consuls were appointed; Napoleon,
Sieyes, and Ducos. A president was to be chosen,
the moment was critical, and rendered the General highly
necessary; he accordingly seized the arm-chair, and his
two acolytes did not venture to dispute it with him.
Besides, Ducos declared himself that moment, once for
all. The General alone could save them, he said: and
thenceforth he was of his opinion in every thing. Sieyes
was greatly mortified, but he was obliged to do the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sieyes was a man of a very selfish disposition. On
the first meeting of the three Consuls in Council, and as
soon as they were alone, Sieyes went in a mysterious
manner to the doors of the apartment, to see whether
any person was within hearing; then, returning to Napoleon,
he said to him with complacency, and in an
under-tone, shewing him, at the same time, a sort of
cabinet. “Do you see that pretty piece of furniture? You
do not, perhaps, suspect how valuable it is?” Napoleon
thought he was directing his attention to some appendage
of the crown, which had, perhaps, been used by
Louis XVI. <a id='corr382.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='That'>“That</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_382.21'><ins class='correction' title='That'>“That</ins></a></span> is not the matter;" said Sieyes, seeing
his mistake, “I am going to let you into the secret;
it contains 800,000 francs!” and his eyes opened wide.
“In our Directorial magistracy, we reflected that a Director
going out of office might very possibly go back to
his family without a denier; a very unbecoming thing:
we therefore invented this little chest from which we
drew a sum for every Director going out of office. There
are now no more Directors; we are therefore the possessors
of the remainder. What shall we do with it?”
Napoleon, who had paid great attention, and began, at
length, to understand, said: “If it comes to my knowledge,
the sum shall go to the public treasury; but if I
should not hear of it (and I know nothing of it yet), you
and Ducos, being two old Directors, can divide it between
you: only make haste, for to-morrow it may perhaps,
be too late. The colleagues did not wait to be
told twice,” observed the Emperor. "Sieyes hastily undertook
the operation, and divided the spoil like the lion
in the fable. He made several lots; he took one as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>eldest Director; another, because he was to have continued
in office longer than his colleague; a third, because
he had suggested the idea of this happy change, &amp;c. In
short he adjudged 600,000 francs to himself, and only
sent 200,000 to poor Ducos, who, when his first emotions
had subsided, insisted on revising this calculation, and
seemed bent on quarrelling with Sieyes. Both of them
reverted to the subject every moment, wishing their
third colleague to arbitrate between them; but the latter
always replied—Settle it between yourselves. Above
all, be quiet, for if the matter should come to my ears,
you would have to give up the whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When we were about to fix on a constitution,” said
the Emperor, “Sieyes treated us with another very entertaining
scene. Circumstances and public opinion had
made him a sort of oracle in these matters; he accordingly
unfolded his various propositions in the committees
of the two councils, with great mystery, importance
and method; they were all adopted, good, bad, and
indifferent. Finally, he crowned the work by displaying
the upshot which had been expected with lively and
anxious impatience: he proposed a Grand Elector, who
was to reside at Versailles, to enjoy six millions per annum,
to represent the national dignity, and to have no
other duty than the nomination of two Consuls, one for
peace and the other for war; entirely independent in
their functions. Moreover, if this Elector should make
a bad choice, the Senate was to <em>absorb</em> him himself.
This was the technical expression, meaning, to remove
him, by replacing him, as a punishment, in the crowd of
private citizens.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon, for want of experience in assemblies, and
also through a degree of circumspection which the circumstances
of the moment required, had taken little or
no share in what had preceded; but now, at this decisive
point, he began, he said, to laugh in Sieyes’s face, and
to cut up all his metaphysical nonsense without mercy.
Sieyes did not like to defend himself, said the Emperor,
nor did he know how to do it. He made the attempt, however,
saying that, after all, a king was nothing more. Napoleon
replied, “But you take the abuse for the principle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>the shadow for the body. And how can you imagine,
M. Sieyes, that a man of any talent or the least honour,
will make up his mind to act the part of a pig fattening
on a few millions?” After this sally, which, said the
Emperor, made those who were present laugh immoderately,
Sieyes remained overwhelmed; it was no longer
in his power to resume the subject of his Grand Elector;
and a First Consul was determined on, who was to have
the supreme decision and the nomination of all offices:
with two accessory Consuls, who were to have deliberate
voices only. It was in fact, from that moment, a unity
of power. The First Consul was precisely the President
of America, veiled under the forms which the irritable
spirit of the times still rendered necessary. The Emperor
accordingly said that his reign began in reality
from that day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor in some measure regretted that Sieyes
had not been nominated one of the consuls. Sieyes,
who at first refused the appointment, afterwards regretted
it himself, but not until it was too late. “He
had fallen into a mistake respecting the nature of these
Consuls,” said Napoleon; “he was fearful of mortification,
and of having the First Consul to contend with at
every step; which would have been the case, if all the
Consuls had been equal; we should then have all been
enemies: but, the constitution having made them subordinate,
there was no room for the struggles of obstinacy,
no cause of enmity, but a thousand reasons for a genuine
unanimity. Sieyes discovered this, but too late.” The
Emperor said he might have been very useful in council—better,
perhaps, than the others, because he had occasionally
novel and most luminous ideas; but that, in
other respects, he was wholly unfit to govern. “After
all,” said the Emperor, “in order to govern it is necessary
to be a military man; one can only rule in boots
and spurs. Sieyes, without being fearful, was always in
fear; his police spies disturbed his rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the Luxembourg, during the provisional consulate,
he often awakened his colleague Napoleon, and harassed
him about the new plots which he heard of every moment
from his private police. “But have they corrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>our guard?” Napoleon used to say. “No.” “Then go
to bed.—In war, as in love, my dear Sir, we must come
to close quarters to conclude matters. It will be time
enough to be alarmed when our 600 men are attacked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said that, for the permanent government,
he had chosen, in <a id='corr385.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Cambacèrés'>Cambacérès</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_385.6'><ins class='correction' title='Cambacèrés'>Cambacérès</ins></a></span> and Lebrun, two
distinguished characters; both prudent, moderate, and
able, but of completely opposite principles—the one the
advocate of abuses, prejudices, old institutions, the revival
of honours and distinctions, &amp;c.—the other cold,
austere, insensible, contending against all these ideas,
yielding to them without illusion, and naturally falling
into ideology.</p>

<p class='c001'>In resuming, he observed that Sieyes might perhaps
have contributed to give a different colour, another characteristic,
to the imperial administration; but it was
observed to him that this variation could not have been
otherwise than injurious, for Napoleon’s choice had been
much approved of at the time. The men he had selected,
it was said, were not liable to be objected to by Europe.
They had greatly contributed to conciliate public opinion
in France, which ran wholly against Sieyes. His name
and the recollections attending it would, in the eyes of
many people, have disgraced the acts in which he might
have taken part; and there was an anecdote eagerly
repeated at the time, which shews all the ill-will that
was borne towards him. It was said that, whilst he
was talking with the Emperor, at the Tuileries, about
Louis XIV. he had suffered the word <em>tyrant</em> to escape
him. "M. l’Abbé," the Emperor was said to have
replied, “if Louis XVI. had been a tyrant, you would
now be saying mass, and I should not be here.” The
Emperor smiled at this anecdote, without confirming or
denying it. It will hereafter appear that it was false.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>FRESH AGGRAVATIONS FROM THE GOVERNOR.—HIS<br /> ABSURDITIES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Saturday 6th to Monday 8th.—I have not mentioned
the Governor for some time. We endeavour to keep
him as much as possible out of our thoughts; we now
scarcely ever adverted to him. His ill-manners, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the vexations we endure from him oblige me to notice
him to-day: they seem to have increased. He has just
withheld from us some letters from Europe, although
they came open, and in the most ostensible manner—merely
because they had not passed through the hands of
the Secretary of State; without considering that a want
of formality can easily be rectified in England, but that
it is irremediable at a distance of two thousand leagues.
If, however, in thus rigorously and literally fulfilling his
instructions, he had only had the humanity to let us know
that he has received these letters, and from whom they
come, he might set our minds at ease with regard to those
respecting whose health, or whose attention to ourselves,
we suffer so much anxiety: but he has the barbarity to
make a mystery of the affair. It is not many days since,
the Countess Bertrand having written to town, he had the
note seized, and sent it back to her as having been written
without his permission. He accompanied this insult
with an official letter, by which he prohibited us, for the
future, from all written or even verbal communication
with the inhabitants, without submitting it to his approbation;
and what is particularly absurd and incredible
is, that he imposed this restriction on our intercourse
with people whom he nevertheless permits us to visit at
our own pleasure. He accompanied the publication of the
act relating to us with commentaries which spread terror
amongst the inhabitants; he complains of the excessive
expense of the Emperor’s table, and insists on great
reductions.—It had not been understood that General
Bonaparte would have so many people about him. Ministers,
he told us ingenuously, had never doubted that the
permission they had sent us to go away would have induced
us to quit the Emperor. All this shuffling produced
an exchange of pretty sharp notes. To one of the
Governor’s communications, in which he said, that if the
restrictions imposed on us seemed too hard, we might
relieve ourselves from them by going away, the Emperor
himself dictated the following addition to the answer we
had already written:—"That, having been honoured by
him during his prosperity, we considered it our chief
pleasure to serve him, now that he could do nothing for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>us; and if there were persons to whom this conduct was
incomprehensible, so much the worse for them."</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NEW VEXATIONS.—THE EMPEROR SELDOM STIRS OUT.—TRISTAN.—LA FONTAINE’S FABLES.—THE BELLY RULES THE WORLD.—DIFFICULTY OF JUDGING OF MEN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Tuesday 9th to Thursday 11th.—The Governor continues
to annoy us, and is incessantly aggravating the
misery of our situation. He seems resolved to place us
in close confinement. He has published a proclamation
in the town, ordering that all letters and notes addressed
by us to the inhabitants, on any occasion whatever, shall
be sent to him within twenty-four hours. He has also
forbidden them to visit the Grand Marshal and his wife,
who live at the entrance of our enclosure. In the beginning
of this blockade of Madame <a id='corr387.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Bertand'>Bertrand</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_387.16'><ins class='correction' title='Bertand'>Bertrand</ins></a></span>, it was so
rigorously enforced that some medicines sent hence by
the doctor for one of the Grand Marshal’s people, who
was dying, could not be delivered; and it was only as
an accommodation that the officer at last took upon him
to let them pass over the wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Governor, having read in a letter, sent by one of
us to Europe, that the writer wanted several articles of
clothing, linen, &amp;c., came and told him that he might
have most of those articles out of the stores sent by
Government for Napoleon: and the individual replying
that he preferred purchasing them, being unwilling to
incur any obligation, the Governor drily answered that
he might pay for them if he had a fancy to do so. To
which the other replied, “Excuse me, Sir, I like to
choose my shops myself.” In consequence of this, the
Governor afterwards sent him word, by the Doctor, that
he should complain of him, for having <em>contemptuously</em>
refused the gifts of Government. The other instantly
replied that he should be much obliged to him; being
much happier to give him an opportunity of transmitting
refusals than requests, to the ministers he served.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these petty tricks, the length and interest of our
readings, and the continuance of the bad weather, which
is dreadful, confine the Emperor more closely than ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>to the house, and overwhelm him with melancholy: he
now never stirs abroad. His amusement is now limited
to going occasionally, about five o’clock, to visit Madame
de Montholon, who has not yet gone abroad since her
lying-in. We all meet there, and the Emperor converses
for half an hour, or three-quarters, before he returns to
his own apartment.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day he met little Tristan, the eldest son of M. de
Montholon, who is only seven or eight years old, and
runs about all day. The Emperor placed him between
his knees, and tried to make him recite some fables, of
which the poor child did not understand two words out
of ten. The Emperor laughed heartily, blaming the
practice of putting La Fontaine into the hands of children
who cannot understand him; and began to explain
these fables to Tristan; endeavouring to render their
meaning more palpable to him; nor could any thing be
more curious than the simplicity, justice, and logic of
his illustrations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whilst he was explaining the fable of the Wolf and
the Lamb, it was extremely laughable to hear the poor
child say <em>Sire</em>, and <em>your Majesty</em>, and in speaking of the
wolf, and to the Emperor, confuse all his expressions;
whilst his ideas were probably in still greater confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor thought this fable had far too much
irony in it to be within the comprehension of children.
It was likewise defective, he observed, in its principle
and its moral; and this was the first time that he had
been struck with these defects. It was false that the
argument of the stronger was always the best; and if it
sometimes happened so, in fact, that, he said, was the
very evil, the abuse, which was to be condemned. The
wolf, ought, therefore, to have been strangled in devouring
the lamb.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tristan is very idle. He confessed to the Emperor
that he did not work every day. “Do you not eat every
day?” said the Emperor to him, “Yes, Sire.” “Well,
then, you ought to work every day; no one should eat
who does not work.” “Oh! if that be the case, I will
work every day,” said the child, quickly. “Such is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>influence of the belly,” said the Emperor, patting that of
little Tristan. "It is hunger that makes the world
move. Come, my little man, if you are a good boy, we’ll
make a page of you." "But I won’t be one," said
Tristan, pouting and looking sulky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our afternoons were occupied in reading something
selected in hopes of enabling us to kill time for an hour
or two. At this period we were reading a voyage to
Spitzbergen; the shipwreck of the Dutch at Nova
Zembla; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Causes celébres</em></span>, the trial of Calas; those
of Martinguerre and the Marchioness of Brinvilliers. The
author observed, in some part of the work, that the face
often gave a false idea of the character. The Emperor
paused, laid down the book, and said, with a look and
tone that denoted conviction: “It is most true, and it
is also true that no study will enable us to avoid this
deception. How many proofs of this kind have I had!
For instance, I had a person about me; his countenance
undoubtedly.... But after all he had a mischievous
eye; I ought to have guessed something from that.”
He then went into some particulars of the character of
the person in question. They had known each other
from infancy, he said; he had long placed his entire
confidence in this individual, who had talent and resources;
the Emperor even thought that he had been
attached and faithful—"But he was much too covetous,"
said he, “he was too fond of money. When I was
dictating to him, and he sometimes had to write <em>millions</em>,
it was never without a peculiar change of countenance, a
smacking of his lips, and restlessness on his chair,
which several times induced me to ask what ailed
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor said this vice was too glaring to allow
of his retaining this person about him; but that, considering
his other qualities, he ought, perhaps, to have
contented himself with removing him into a different
situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>THE IRON MASK, &amp;C.—INGENIOUS FICTION.</p>

<p class='c001'>Friday, 12th.—The conversation to-day led us to speak
of the Iron Mask, and we took a review of what has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>been said on the subject by Voltaire, Dutens, and others;
and of what is found respecting him in Richelieu’s
Memoirs. In these it is well known that he is said to
have been the twin-brother of Louis XIV., and the elder
of the two. On this occasion, some one added that,
being employed in making out a pedigree, a person had
come to him to demonstrate seriously to him that
Napoleon was a lineal descendant from this Iron Mask,
and consequently the legitimate heir of Louis XIII. and
Henry IV., in preference to Louis XIV. and all his issue.
The Emperor also said that he had heard something
about it, and added that the credulity of mankind and
their love of the marvellous are so great that it would
not have been difficult to make out and substantiate
something of the kind for the multitude, and that there
would not have been wanting certain persons in the
Senate to sanction it; probably, he observed, the very
men who at a later period were so eager to revile him,
as soon as they saw him in adversity.</p>

<p class='c001'>We then went on to trace the foundation and the
progress of this story. The name of the Governor of
the Island of St. Marguerite, to whom the custody of
the Iron Mask was entrusted, was M. de Bonpart, a
circumstance, to begin with, very singular. This man,
it was asserted, was aware of the origin of his prisoner.
He had a daughter: she and the prisoner were both
young; they saw each other and loved. The Governor,
having informed the Court of this circumstance, it was
decided that there was no great objection to allowing the
unfortunate captive to seek in love an alleviation of his
misery, and they were married.</p>

<p class='c001'>The person who was speaking at this moment said
that, at the time the above particulars were related to
him, he had been very much entertained by them, and
had happened to say that he thought the story very
ingeniously imagined; upon which the narrator of it
became excessively angry, maintaining that the marriage
could very easily be verified by the registers of one of
the parishes of Marseilles, which he named. He added
that the children born of this marriage were silently and
secretly conveyed to Corsica, where the difference of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>language, chance, or perhaps intention had, changed
the name of Bonpart into Bonaparte and Buonaparte,
which, after all, has the same meaning, and is in fact
the same thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>After this anecdote, it was added that, at the time of
the revolution, a similar story had been made in favour
of the Orleans branch. It was founded in a document
found in the Bastille, and surmised that Anne of Austria,
who was brought to bed after twenty-three years of
sterility, had been delivered of a girl, and that Louis
XIII. fearing she might have no more children, had
been induced to put away that girl and falsely to substitute
in her stead a boy, which was Louis XIV.; that
the following year, however, the Queen had been again
brought to bed, and this time really of a boy, which boy
was Philip, the head of the house of Orleans, who thus
turned out to be with his descendants the legitimate
heirs to the throne, whilst Louis XIV. and his issue
were only intruders and usurpers. According to that
story the Iron Mask was a girl. A pamphlet on this
subject was circulated in the provinces at the time the
Bastille was taken, but the story did not gain credit,
and very quietly disappeared, without having, it seems,
engaged the attention of the capital even for a moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>JUNOT, HIS WIFE, &amp;C.</p>

<p class='c001'>Saturday, 13th.—The conversation again fell upon
Junot. Of the considerable fortunes which the Emperor
had bestowed, that of Junot, he said, was one of the
most extravagant. The sums he had given him almost
exceeded belief, and yet he was always in debt; he had
squandered treasures, without credit to himself, without
discernment or taste, and, too frequently, the Emperor
added, in gross debauchery.</p>

<p class='c001'>He has been known more than once, after having taken
a most copious and substantial breakfast, in his magnificent
<em>hotel</em> at Paris, fired with anger at the most trifling
demand made by the most insignificant creditor, to threaten
to pay the debt with his sword. Every time he saw
the Emperor, said Napoleon, it was to hint at some fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>embarrassment, be reprimanded and assisted. In the
campaign of Austerlitz, he came to the Emperor at
Schönbrun; but this time, said Napoleon, it was not to
intercede precisely for himself. He took at this period a
most lively interest in the beautiful Madame Recamier.
He had just arrived from Paris, and began his conversation
with the Emperor by a most virulent philippic
against M. de Marbois, then Minister of the Treasury,
who had been base enough, he said, to refuse M. Recamier
a loan of only two millions, to save him from bankruptcy.
All Paris was indignant. This Marbois, he
added, was a wicked man, an unworthy servant, who did
not love the Emperor. He, Junot, had gone to him and
had used every endeavour to persuade him, but to no
purpose. He had represented to him the enormity of
his conduct, and had assured him (and such added
Junot was the general opinion in Paris,) that if the Emperor
had been in the capital he would have immediately
ordered the money to be given to M. Recamier. “He
was on a wrong scent,” said the Emperor, "for I coolly
replied to this passionate lover who was almost out of
his senses: ‘You and Paris are both mistaken, I should
not have ordered even two thousand <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>sous</em></span> to be given;
and I should have been very much displeased with De
Marbois if he had acted otherwise than he has done. <em>I</em>
am not Madame Recamier’s lover, and I do not come forward
to the assistance of merchants who keep up an establishment
of six hundred thousands francs per annum.
Know that, M. Junot, and learn also that the Treasury
does not lend money to those whom it knows to have
been long since on the road to bankruptcy; it has other
claims to satisfy.’ Junot," added the Emperor, “was
obliged to calm his emotion, thinking probably that
there were hard-hearted people at Vienna as well as at
Paris.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Junot travelled as fast as the Emperor himself; he
had his relays, said Napoleon, hundreds of horses, and
other extravagances of the kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor added that, not so much in his capacity
as sovereign, but as being fond of Junot, and actuated
also by a sort of feeling derived from the similarity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>birth-place, he being also originally from Corsica, he had
one day sent for Madame Junot, in order to give her
some paternal admonitions on the subject of the extravagance
of her husband’s expenditure, the profusion of
diamonds which she herself had inconsiderately displayed
after her return from Portugal, and her intimate connections
with a certain foreigner, which might give umbrage
in a political point of view. But she rejected this advice,
dictated alone by concern for her interest. “She grew
angry,” said the Emperor, “and treated me like a child;
nothing then remained for me to do but to send her
about her business, and abandon her to her fate. She
fancied herself a princess of the family of the Comnenes;
and Junot had been made to believe it when he was induced
to marry her. Her family was from Corsica, and
resided in the neighbourhood of mine; they were under
great obligations to my mother, not merely for her
benevolence towards them, but for services of a more
positive nature.” The Emperor then gave the following
explanation:</p>

<p class='c001'>"The Genoese, in evacuating the Morea, had formerly
carried a colony of Maniotes to Corsica and settled them
in the neighbourhood of Ajaccio. M. de Vergennes,
while he was ambassador at Constantinople, married a
Greek woman; and, on his return to France, being
greatly in favour with Louis XVI. he took it into his
head that he must have married a princess. It so happened
that some political circumstances occurred to
favour his wish; the downfall of Constantinople was
believed in at that moment, and it would have suited
France to advance some pretensions to a portion of that
empire. A man of the name of Comnene, a relation of
Madame de Vergennes, was therefore sent for from the
Greek colony near Ajaccio, and, having been brought to
Versailles, was soon after, by virtue of letters-patent of
Louis XVI., acknowledged a descendant from the Emperors
of Constantinople. This said Comnene was a
large farmer, whose sister had unexpectedly married,
some years before, a Frenchman, a clerk in the victualling
department named P—. After the elevation of the family,
and through the interest of M, de Vergennes, this P—,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>clerk in the victualling department, had become a man of
great consequence, having had the contract for supplying
the whole army of Rochambeau. The daughter of the
clerk was this very Madame Junot, duchess of Abrantes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Junot, in the campaign of Russia, gave me great
cause of dissatisfaction;” said the Emperor, “he was no
longer the same man, and committed some gross blunders
which cost us dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After the return from Moscow, Junot, in consequence
of the dissatisfaction he had given, lost the governorship
of Paris; and the Emperor sent him to Venice. However
that species of disgrace was almost immediately
softened, by his appointment as Governor-general of Illyria;
but the blow was struck. The frequent incoherences
which had been observed in Junot’s behaviour for
some time past, and which had arisen from the excesses
in which he had indulged, broke out at last into complete
insanity. It was necessary to secure him, and to
convey him home to his paternal mansion, where he died
miserably shortly afterwards, having mutilated his person
with his own hands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . .</p>

<h3 class='c006'>MARSHAL LANNES.—MURAT AND HIS WIFE, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Sunday, 14th.—During the dinner, speaking of dress,
it was said that, amongst the number of great personages
of that time, none had carried extravagance in that
point further than Murat, and yet, some one observed,
his dress was for the most part so singular and fantastic
that the public called him King Franconi.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor laughed very heartily, and confessed that
certain costumes and manners sometimes gave to Murat
the appearance of a quack operator or a mountebank. It
was added that Bernadotte also took infinite pains with
his dress, and that Lannes bestowed much time upon his.
The Emperor expressed himself much surprised at what
he had heard respecting the two latter, and this led him
to repeat how sincerely he regretted the loss of Marshal
Lannes. “Poor Lannes,” said he, "had passed the night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>which preceded the battle, in Vienna, and not alone.
He appeared on the field without having taken any food,
and fought the whole day. The physician said that this
triple concurrence of circumstances caused his death, he
required a great deal of strength after the wound to enable
him to bear it, and unfortunately nature was almost
exhausted before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is generally said,” the Emperor observed, “that
there are certain wounds, to which death seems preferable;
but this is very seldom the case, I assure you. It
is at the moment we are going to part with existence
that we cling to it with all our might. Lannes, the
most courageous of men, deprived of both his legs, would
not hear of death, and was irritated to such a degree
as to declare that the two surgeons who attended him
deserved to be hanged for behaving so brutally towards
a Marshal. He had unfortunately overheard them whisper
to each other, as they thought without being heard,
that it was impossible he could recover. Every moment
the unfortunate Lannes called for the Emperor;
he twined himself round me,” said Napoleon, “with all
he had left of life; he would hear of no one but me, he
thought but of me; it was a kind of instinct! Undoubtedly
he loved his wife and children better than me; yet
he did not speak of them: it was he that protected them,
whilst I on the contrary was his protector. I was for
him something vague and undefined, a superior being,
his Providence, which he implored!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Somebody then observed that the world had spoken
very differently on the subject; that it had been reported
that Lannes had died like a maniac, vociferating imprecations
against the Emperor, at whom he seemed enraged;
and it was added that he had always an aversion
to the Emperor, and had often manifested it to him with
insolence. “What an absurdity,” said the Emperor,
“Lannes, on the contrary, adored me. He was assuredly
one of the men on whom I could most implicitly rely.
It is very true that, in the impetuosity of his disposition,
he has sometimes suffered some hasty expressions against
me to escape his lips, but he would probably have broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the head of any person who had chanced to hear
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Returning to Murat, some one observed that he had
greatly influenced the unfortunate events of 1814. “He
determined them,” said the Emperor, “he is one of the
principal causes of our being here. But the fault is originally
mine. There were several men whom I had
made too great; I had raised them above the sphere of
their intelligence. I was reading, some days since, his
proclamation on abandoning the Viceroy, which I had
not seen before. It is difficult to conceive any thing
disgraced by a greater degree of turpitude: he says in
that document that the moment is come to choose between
two banners, that of crime and that of virtue. It
is my banner which he calls the banner of crime! and it
is Murat, my creature, the husband of my sister, the
man who owed every thing to me, who would have
been nothing without me, who exists by me, and is
known through me alone—it is Murat who writes this!
It is impossible to desert the cause of misfortune with
more unfeeling brutality; and to run with more unblushing
baseness to hail a new destiny.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From that moment, Madame (mother of the Emperor)
refused to have any thing more to do with either Murat
or his wife; to all their entreaties she invariably answered
that she held traitors and treachery in abhorrence.
As soon as she was at Rome, after the disasters
of 1814, Murat hastened to send her eight magnificent
horses out of his stables at Naples; but Madame would
not accept them. She resisted, in like manner, every
effort of her daughter Caroline, who constantly repeated
that, after all, the fault was not hers; that she had no
share in it; that she could not command her husband.
But Madame answered, like Clytemnestra—"If you could
not command him, you ought at least to have opposed
him:—but what struggles have you made? what blood
has flowed? At the expense of your own life, you
ought to have defended your brother, your benefactor,
your master, against the sanguinary attempts of your
husband.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>“On my return from Elba,” said the Emperor, "Murat’s
head was turned, on hearing that I had landed in
France. The first intelligence he received of this event
informed him that I was at Lyons. He was accustomed to
my great returns of fortune; he had more than once seen
me placed in most extraordinary circumstances. On this
occasion, he thought me already master of all Europe, and
determined to endeavour to wrest Italy from me; for that
was his object, the aim of all his hopes. It was in vain
that some men, of the greatest influence amongst the
nations which he attempted to excite to rebellion, threw
themselves at his feet and assured him that he was mistaken;
that the Italians had a king on whom alone they
had bestowed their love and their esteem. Nothing
could stop him; he ruined himself, and contributed to
ruin us a second time; for Austria, supposing that he
was acting at my instigation, would not believe my professions,
and mistrusted me. Murat’s unfortunate end
corresponds with his conduct. Murat was endowed
with extraordinary courage and little intelligence. The
too great disproportion between those two qualities explains
the man entirely. It was difficult, even impossible,
to be more courageous than Murat and Lannes;
but Murat had remained courageous and nothing more.
The mind of Lannes, on the contrary, had risen to the
level of his courage; he had become a giant. <a id='corr397.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“However'>However</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_397.26'><ins class='correction' title='“However'>However</ins></a></span>,"
said the Emperor, in ending the conversation,
“the execution of Murat is nevertheless horrible. It is
an event in the history of the morals of Europe; an infraction
of the rules of public decorum.—A king has
caused another king, acknowledged by all the others, to
be shot! What a spell he has broken!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

  <h2 class='c014'>SUMMARY OF THE THREE MONTHS OF <br /> APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I have already observed that, in a work like the present,
it is impossible to keep up in any point a unity of
interest and of object; I shall, therefore, now attempt
to supply this defect by retracing, in a very few words,
and uninterruptedly, the circumstances of aggravation
which have occurred in the Emperor’s situation during
these three months; the repeated instances of ill-treatment
to which he has been subjected; the visible decline
of his health; the general tenor of his habits; the
principal topics of his conversation:—in a word, the
bulletin, both physical and moral, of his person, during
that short space of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st. A new Governor arrives, who turns out to be a
man of either very narrow views, or very bad intentions—a
corporal with his watch-word, instead of a general
with his instructions.</p>

<p class='c001'>2dly. A declaration is required from every one of the
captives that he submits beforehand to all the restrictions
that may be imposed on Napoleon, and this in the
hopes of detaching them from his person.</p>

<p class='c001'>3dly. An official communication is made to us of the
convention of the allied Sovereigns, who, without further
ceremony, proclaim and sanction the banishment of
Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c001'>4thly. We receive the bill of the British Parliament,
which converts into a law the act of oppression of the
English ministers towards the person of Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c001'>5thly. Lastly, Commissioners come in the name of
their Sovereigns, to watch over the fetters, and contemplate
the sufferings of the victim. Thus our horizon
grows darker and darker, our chains are shortened, all
hopes of amelioration vanish, and the most gloomy
prospects are all that the future presents.</p>

<p class='c001'>The arrival of the new Governor is the signal for the
infliction of greater hardships. For the person of the
Emperor it is the commencement of a new series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>torments; every day he is wounded by the recurrence of
some petty vexation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first step of Sir Hudson Lowe is an insult; his
first word one of cruelty; one of his first acts, an act of
inhumanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>After that, he seems to have no other occupation, to
have received no other instruction, than to torment us
and make us suffer under every shape, on every occasion,
and in every way.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, who had at first resolved to adopt a
system of strict stoicism, is nevertheless moved with
indignation at this conduct, and expresses himself in
strong terms. Conversations grow warm; the breach
is made; it will grow wider every day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor’s health is visibly affected, and we can
observe a rapid alteration. Contrary to his natural temperament,
he very frequently feels indisposed; on one
occasion he is confined to his room for six days running,
without going out at all. A secret melancholy, which
endeavours to conceal itself from every eye, and perhaps
from his own, begins to take possession of him; the
latent seeds of disease appear already to be lurking in
his system. He contracts every day the circle, already
so confined, of his movements and his diversions. He
gives up riding on horseback; he no longer invites any
English to dinner,—he even abandons his daily occupations.
The dictations in which he had hitherto seemed
to take pleasure, are suspended. Disgust had seized him,
he would sometimes say to me, and he could not muster
courage enough to resume them. The greatest part of
his days is passed in turning over books in his own
apartment, or in conversing with us either publicly or
in private; and in the evening, after dinner, he reads to
us some plays of our great poets, or any other work
which chance or the choice of the moment brings to his
hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the serenity of his mind, the equanimity of his
disposition towards us, are not in the least impaired;
on the contrary, we seem more united like one family.
He is more ours, and we belong more to him; his conversations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>offer a greater degree of confidence, freedom,
and interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>He would now often send for me into his room, to converse
with him; and these private conversations would
sometimes lead him to subjects of great importance,—such
as the war in Russia, that of Spain, the conferences
of Tilsit and Erfurth, which will be found in this portion
of my Memoirs.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Note by M.B.C.</em>—Bonaparte attached a high value to the
proofs that his return was not effected by military manœuvres. I
am sorry that I have not by me six pages which he had written or
dictated on this subject, and which he had carefully corrected. He
put them into my hands at the time of the communication referred
to here. He desired that I would reply to Lord Castlereagh, who, in
a speech in parliament, had attributed all his success to the army.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not choosing to write at all, till I had ascertained that it was not
a despot that I was restoring to France, I declined this task; and,
in 1815, I entrusted the sketch which Napoleon had given me to
one of my friends, who set out for England, and from whom I have
hitherto neglected to get it back again. It was written with much
warmth; it contained expressions singular, but powerful, a great
rapidity of thought, and some strokes of real eloquence.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This event took place in the presence of twenty-two persons:—The Emperor.—Dubois,
Corvisart, Bourdier and Ivan.—Madames de Montebello, de
Lucay, and de Montesquiou. The six first ladies:—Ballant, Deschamps,
Durant, Hureau, Nabusson, and Gerard. Five ladies of the bed-chamber.—Mademoiselles
Honoré, Edouard, Barbier, Aubert, and Geoffroy. The
Keeper;—Madame Blaise, and two maids of the wardrobe.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an interesting work published some years since relative to
the return from Elba, there is this passage: “When young Napoleon
came into the world, he was supposed to be dead; he had
neither warmth, motion, nor respiration. Repeated efforts were
made to produce signs of life, when the hundred guns destined to
proclaim his birth were successively fired. The commotion and
shock which they occasioned acted so powerfully on the organs of
the royal infant as to bring him to his senses.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is a singular fact that the person from whom I had this information
on agriculture, in Languedoc, was the identical M. de
Villèle, who has since become celebrated.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day at Longwood running over the list of the senators
who had signed the deposition, one of us pointed out the name of
M. de Valence, signed as secretary. But another explained that
this signature was false, that M. de Valence had complained of it,
and protested against it. “It is very true,” said the Emperor, “I
know it; he has behaved well; Valence was true to the nation.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have since learned that this watch, the faithful companion
of his wonderful achievements during the Campaigns in Italy and
Egypt, has passed into the hands of the Grand Marshal.—The
Emperor complained that his watch did not go, or that it went ill;
and we had in vain endeavoured to get it set to rights: when one
day, looking at a watch which General Bertrand had just received
from the Cape, he said: <a id='corr45.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='I shall'>“I shall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.40'><ins class='correction' title='I shall'>“I shall</ins></a></span> keep this and give you mine: it
does not go now, but it struck two on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>plateau</em></span> of Rivoli, when
I gave orders for the operations of the day.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Time, which explains all things, has shewn the little springs
which brought about one of our greatest catastrophes. I received
the following particulars from one who acted a part in the events
of the day:—</p>

<p class='c001'>On hearing that Napoleon had arrived at the Elysée from Waterloo,
Fouché flew to the dissatisfied and suspicious Members
of the Chambers exclaiming, “To arms! He has returned desperate,
and is about to dissolve the Chambers and seize the dictatorship.
We cannot endure the restoration of tyranny.” He then
hastened to the best friends of Napoleon. “Are you aware,” said
he, “what a terrible fermentation has risen up against the Emperor
among certain deputies? We can only save Napoleon by facing
them boldly, by showing them the full power of our party, and
how easily the Chambers may be dissolved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The friends of Napoleon, easily duped in this sudden crisis,
failed not to follow, perhaps even to overstep, the suggestions of
Fouché, who now returned to the distrustful party and said, <a id='corr55.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='You'>“You</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.36'><ins class='correction' title='You'>“You</ins></a></span>
see his best friends are agreed on this point: the danger is urgent:
and in a few hours there will be no remedy. The Chambers will
be no more, and we shall be very culpable in letting slip the only
opportunity of opposing him.” Thus the permanence of the Chambers,
the forced abdication of the Emperor, and the downfall of a
great empire, were brought about by petty intrigue, by ante-chamber
report and gossip. Ah, Fouché! how well the Emperor knew
you, when he said, that your ugly foot was sure to be thrust into
every body’s shoes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since my return to Europe, I have been assured that there
exist two notes, written in pencil by the Emperor Alexander, urgently
soliciting that he might be allowed to pass. If this be true,
what a singular vicissitude of fortune presents itself! The magnanimous
Conqueror was doomed to perish in captivity, far from
Europe, and separated from his family; and this too, in the name
of the conquered party, to whose prayers he had so generously
listened.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On reading this reflection of Napoleon’s, an officer in the confidence
of Admiral Villeneuve wrote to me that the letter of Decrès
to that Admiral before the arrival of M. de Rosilly, appointed
to supersede him, concluded thus;—"Sail as soon as you find a
favourable opportunity: do not shun the enemy; on the contrary
attack him wherever you fall in with him, since the Emperor cares
little about losing ships, so he loses them with honour." This letter
was the only one which the officer in question saved from the
Admiral’s portfolio, before he threw it into the sea, at the moment
of striking the flag.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I must however confess that my opinion is likely to be
erroneous, if, as I have been informed, the statements of the
registers in France, since the introduction of the equalization of
punishments, when compared with those drawn up during a similar
interval under the old penal laws, present a diminution in the
number of criminals.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I was sorry to find, on perusing the Doctor’s work, that he
has totally neglected the observations and corrections with which
I furnished him; and has strangely misrepresented the particulars
which I communicated.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This story is positively contradicted. It appears that a
fondness for the marvellous produced this fable.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have been assured that this circumstance is erroneous, and
that relative to Prince Eugène inaccurate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I received from the mouth of the Prince Primate some curious
details concerning Josephine’s marriage and divorce. Madame de
Beauharnais was married to General Buonaparte, by a non-juring
priest, who, by mere accident, had neglected to procure the requisite
authority from the curate of the parish. This, or some other
informality in the marriage, afterwards occupied the attention of
Cardinal Fesch; and, whether from his own scruples or otherwise,
he succeeded at the time of the coronation in persuading the Emperor
and Empress to be married over again by him, privately; or
at least to go over as much of the ceremony as he thought necessary.
At the divorce, the civil separation was pronounced by the
Senate. With regard to the religious separation, the Emperor
would not apply to the Pope, and there was no necessity for so
doing. Cardinal Fesch having re-married the parties without witnesses,
the Officiality of Paris declared that no marriage had taken
place. On this judgment being delivered, the Empress Josephine
summoned Cardinal Fesch to Malmaison, and asked him whether
he could bear witness and sign a declaration that she had been
married and lawfully married. “Doubtless,” replied the Cardinal,
“I can bear testimony to the fact, and will sign the declaration,”
which he accordingly did.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” said I to the Prince Primate, “what judgment was pronounced
by the Officiality of Paris?”—"The only proper one,"
replied the Prince.—"What then became of the declaration of Cardinal
Fesch? was it false?"—"Not in his opinion," said the Prince.
“He had acted upon the Italian doctrine, by which Cardinals assume
the right of marrying without witnesses, which however is
not recognised in France, where a marriage is thereby rendered
null.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears, however, that Josephine required this declaration
only for her own satisfaction, and that she never made any other
use of it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How justly did the Emperor paint his mother’s character!
On my return to Europe I was delighted to witness the literal confirmation
of all that he had said respecting her.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as I disclosed to Madame Mère the Emperor’s real
situation, and declared my resolution to exert all my efforts to
alleviate his misery, the answer returned to me by the courier
was, that her whole fortune was at her son’s disposal, and that she
would earn her livelihood if necessary by going to service. She at
the same time, authorised me, though I was not personally known
to her, to draw immediately in her name for any sum that I might
think necessary for the Emperor’s use. Cardinal Fesch also
tendered his services in the most affectionate way; and I must
take this opportunity of mentioning that all the different members
of the Emperor’s family evinced equal love, zeal, and devotedness.
So long as my health permitted me to keep up a correspondence
with them, I received a multitude of letters, which
form altogether a most interesting collection. They reflect honour
on the hearts of the writers, and they would have proved a source
of consolation to the Emperor, had the restrictions of the
English government permitted me to submit them to his
perusal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c001'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Emperor had been informed that two or three of the widows

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
